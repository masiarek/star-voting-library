"""
test_runoff_percent.py
======================
Locks the optional runoff percentage summary, in BOTH of its two forms:

  * ON SCREEN — one *self-reconciling* line. It uses the DECIDED-VOTERS
    denominator (voters who expressed a preference between the two finalists,
    so Equal Support is EXCLUDED) AND states that count against the total
    ballots with the Equal Support gap named inline — "N of TOTAL (E Equal
    Support)" — so the denominator never has to be inferred by subtraction.
  * IN THE `_tabulated` COPY — a "Runoff math" funnel that makes the same
    arithmetic explicit (TOTAL − Equal Support = decided), then the finalists'
    shares of the decided voters.

Behaviour locked here:
  * the on-screen line is ON by default (house default since 2026-08-09 —
    case files carry no `options:` block; the engine defaults ARE the house
    style);
  * a file can still opt OUT with `options: { show_runoff_percent: false }`;
  * the always-full `_tabulated` copy carries the funnel regardless of the
    file option;
  * the funnel does NOT appear on screen (echo stays a single line).

Fixture election (scores 0-5):

    A,B,C
    5,4,0      A>B
    5,4,0      A>B
    2,5,0      B>A
    3,3,0      A==B  -> Equal Support
    4,0,5      A>B

  Scores: A=19, B=16, C=5  -> finalists A,B.
  Runoff A-vs-B: A=3, B=1, Equal Support=1  -> decided=4 (NOT 5), total=5.
  Expected (two lines):  "Voters with a preference: 4 of 5 (1 Equal Support)."
                         "A 3 (75%) vs B 1 (25%); majority = 3."
