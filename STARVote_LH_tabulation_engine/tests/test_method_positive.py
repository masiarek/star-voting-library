"""
test_method_positive.py
=======================
Discovery test for the NON-(single-winner-STAR) teaching cases — the coverage
gap left by test_single_winner_positive.py (which asserts only single-winner
STAR files in its fixed folder list).

Every *.yaml under the teaching roots (01_STAR through 05_Ranked_Robin,
method_comparisons, 06_Other — recursively, skipping *_tabulated
mirrors) that declares a
top-level `expected_winners:` list is run through the real CLI. The run must
exit 0 and elect exactly the declared winners — RCV-IRV, Ranked Robin,
Approval, STV, and the multi-winner STAR family (bloc / sss / rrv / allocated)
included.

Winner extraction is text-light but format-aware:
  - Ranked Robin prints  "Winner — Ranked Robin (RCV-RR): <name>"
  - every other method prints a "Winner(s) — …" / "Winners — …" header line
    followed by one indented winner name per line.

Single-winner STAR files in the folders test_single_winner_positive.py already
covers are skipped here so each case runs once per suite.
