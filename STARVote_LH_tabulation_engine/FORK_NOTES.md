# Fork Notes — starvote (vendored fork)

> **This page covers only the vendored upstream `starvote/` package.** For the full, consolidated list of *everything* we add to or change in the LH tabulator — new methods, new reports, and fixes — see **[`LH_ENGINE_CHANGES.md`](LH_ENGINE_CHANGES.md)** (canonical).

This directory contains a **vendored fork** of Larry Hastings' STAR Voting engine, [`larryhastings/starvote`](https://github.com/larryhastings/starvote). We do not submit pull requests upstream; we edit the engine directly here and keep it as part of this project (the `masiarek/YAML` repo).

## What is what

| Path | Origin | Edit it when… |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `starvote/` (`__init__.py`, `__main__.py`, `reference.py`) | **Upstream engine** (Larry Hastings) | You're changing how the *voting algorithm itself* works — scoring, tabulation, tiebreak mechanics, CLI/option parsing of the engine. |
| `starvote_larry_hastings.py` | **Our code** | Anything about how *we* run, feed, or present an election — our `LotNumberTiebreaker`, matrix visualization, colored output, file loading. This `import starvote`; it should never duplicate engine logic. |
| `tools_adam/` | **Our code** | Helper/automation scripts (conversion, simulation, BetterVoting automation, etc.). |
| `tests/`, `test_elections/` | Mixed | Upstream tests plus ours. |

**Rule of thumb:** "Would Larry want this in the engine for everyone?" → it goes in `starvote/`. "Is this about *my* analysis, display, or workflow?" → it goes in our script/tools.

> Our wrapper script (`starvote_larry_hastings.py`), its display options, the `_tabulated` output format, and the `tools_adam/tabulate_all.py` batch runner are documented in **[starvote_larry_hastings.py — presentation wrapper](README_larry_hastings.md)**.

## Upstream baseline

The pristine upstream version is **starvote 2.1.6**, verified byte-identical to the PyPI release. It is recorded as the git tag:

```
starvote-upstream-2.1.6   ->  commit daa6bbd
```

### See exactly what we've changed in the engine, any time

```bash
# full diff of our engine edits vs pristine upstream
git diff starvote-upstream-2.1.6 -- STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/starvote/

# just a summary
git diff --stat starvote-upstream-2.1.6 -- STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/starvote/
```

## Current divergence from upstream 2.1.6

**The engine algorithm is essentially unchanged.** `git diff --stat` against the tag reports a large line count (≈ +725 / −299 even with `-w`), but that is almost entirely **line-reflow** (signatures and long calls re-wrapped): the two files are ~97 % character-identical once whitespace is removed, `__version__` is still `2.1.6`, no functions were removed, and exactly **one** helper was added (`bool_converter`). The *functional* edits are two optional output toggles plus one small tiebreak **bug fix** (see below):

- **`print_averages`** option (default `False`) + CLI flag `-a` / `--print-averages` and config key `print averages = <bool>`. Suppresses the averages line unless asked.
- **`print_maximum_score`** option (default `False`) + CLI flag `-M` / `--print-maximum-score` and config key `print maximum score = <bool>`. Suppresses the "Maximum score is …" line unless asked.
- `bool_converter` parses those two boolean config keys.
- Both options are forwarded to method functions only when they differ from the default, so older/reference method implementations don't break.

### Bug fix — five-star tiebreak default score (2025)

- **File/location:** `starvote/__init__.py`, `_maximum_score_count_round()`, the 2-candidate fast path (the `if len(candidates) == 2:` branch).
- **What changed:** `ballot_get(candidate1, 1)` → `ballot_get(candidate1, 0)`. The `.get()` default for the *second* candidate was `1` while the first candidate (and the general N-candidate path) correctly used `0`.
- **Effect:** this function powers the **five-star** tiebreaker (it counts votes equal to `maximum_score`). With the wrong default, a ballot that *omits* candidate1 contributed a phantom score of `1`; that only equals `maximum_score` when `maximum_score == 1` (Approval-style), so the miscount was **dormant for normal 0–5 STAR** (full ballots always include both candidates, and `1 ≠ 5`). It was still a latent correctness bug, now aligned with `candidate0` and the general path so all three agree.
- **Why upstream:** it's the *voting algorithm's* tiebreak mechanics, so it lives in `starvote/` (per the table above), not our wrapper. Consider offering it to Larry.
- **Regression guard:** the four `01_STAR/tie_break_dead_rung/` cases exercise the five-star rung firing vs. falling through to the lot in both rounds.

> **Correction (do not repeat the old claim):** the **`No Preference` → `Equal Support`** relabel, the Runoff (Preference) Matrix, `[Divergence from STAR]`, the `[Runoff Reversal]` summary, and `show_runoff_percent` are **NOT** engine edits — they all live in our wrapper `starvote_larry_hastings.py`. The vendored `starvote/` package still prints "No Preference" internally. Keeping the engine pristine-but-for-the-two-toggles is deliberate: it makes re-pulling a future upstream release trivial.

To regenerate this list precisely at any time, run the `git diff` commands above and compare the `def`/`class` inventory of the two versions.

## How to pull a future upstream update (if ever wanted)

1. Download the new pristine version (e.g. `pip download starvote==X.Y.Z --no-deps --no-binary :all:`).
2. Tag it: copy the new `starvote/` over a clean checkout, commit, `git tag starvote-upstream-X.Y.Z`.
3. Re-apply our diff: `git diff starvote-upstream-2.1.6 starvote-upstream-X.Y.Z` shows what upstream changed; resolve against our edits listed above.

Because our edits are small and localized, re-applying them by hand is the simplest path.
