build_divergence_index.py
=========================
Cross-method divergence ledger for the *curated* single-winner STAR library.

For every real single-winner STAR election in the repo it re-tabulates the
SAME ballots under the other methods and records where they disagree with STAR:

    STAR  vs  RCV-IRV  vs  Ranked Robin (RCV-RR / Copeland)  vs  Approval

The point is NOT to hunt for divergence in random ballots (that's what
tools_adam/find_*divergence.py do, and that's the cherry-picking trap). This
walks only Adam's hand-built teaching elections, reports a base rate
("D of N diverged"), and groups the hits by a decision tree so the genuinely
teachable cases float to the top and tie-break artifacts are flagged, not
promoted.

Score -> rank is the tricky bit, so we record BOTH conversions (house decision):
  * STRICT : equal non-zero scores broken by lot/priority order -> a full
             strict ranking (the engine's canonical `score_ballot_to_ranking`).
  * WEAK   : equal scores stay equal (no head-to-head preference between them) —
             the natural reading of a score ballot.
RCV-RR and Condorcet are computed under BOTH (they genuinely differ when a
ballot has tied scores). RCV-IRV cannot represent equal ranks (pyrankvote needs
a strict order), so "weak IRV" does not exist; instead IRV is run STRICT and we
add a fragility probe (re-run under REVERSED priority) plus the engine's own
tied-ballot count, so a tie-break-driven IRV result is flagged rather than sold
as a deep method difference.

Outputs (generated — safe to delete and rebuild):
  method_comparisons/divergence_review/INDEX.md       human review surface, grouped by bucket
  method_comparisons/divergence_review/divergence.csv  one row per election, all winners + flags
