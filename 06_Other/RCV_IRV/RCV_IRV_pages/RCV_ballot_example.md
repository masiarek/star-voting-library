# RCV-IRV — a basic ranked-ballot example (3 candidates)

*Generated from [`RCV_ballot_example.yaml`](../RCV_ballot_example.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [RCV-IRV (Instant Runoff)](../../../00_start_here/RCV_IRV) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** A

## Scenario

A first ranked-ballot count: 100 voters, three candidates, weighted rows
like "40:A>C>B". A leads with 40 first choices but no majority; C (25) is
eliminated, C's ballots transfer to A, and A wins 65-35. Use it to learn the
round-by-round report before the pathology cases (center_squeeze,
monotonicity, summability in method_comparisons/) show what elimination
order can do.

## Ballots

Each row is one voter's ranking, most-preferred first (`N:` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
40:A>C>B
35:B>C>A
25:C>A>B
```
