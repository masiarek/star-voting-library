# Tips — Choosing the Number of Voters in STAR Examples

How many ballots should a teaching example use? It matters more than it looks, because of one collision: voter **counts** and star **scores** are both small numbers.

## The collision to avoid

It only happens in the **weighted** (`Count × scores`) form. With a small count, a row like:

```
5 × 5,4,3
```

makes the reader pause — *is that 5 voters, or a 5-star score?* That's the mental gymnastics. It does **not** happen with individual ballots (one row = one voter, no `Count` column), where every small number is unambiguously a score.

## The one rule that prevents it

- **Individual ballots** (one voter per row): any size is fine — small is great.
- **Weighted ballots** (a `Count:` column): keep **every count ≥ 6**, clear of the 0–5 ceiling. Then a count can never be mistaken for a score.

## Pick the magnitude by the lesson

| Goal | Voter count | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| First mechanics — one ballot, the two rounds | **1**, individual | nothing competes; no count column to confuse |
| Show ballot variety / how to vote | **3–7** individual ballots | each row is one voter; scores stay unambiguous |
| An effect you can add up by hand | **tens, counts ≥ 6** (e.g. 12/10/14, 30/25/35) | big enough to avoid the collision, small enough to verify the sums |
| A proportions / majority story | **a round total: 100** (or 18, 36, 90, 360) | percentages read straight off the counts ("61% majority") |

## The percentages-vs-arithmetic trade-off

- **100 voters** → percentages are free, but the scoring-round totals get large (e.g. `A -- 375`) and the audience can't check them in their head.
- **Tens of voters** → totals are addable live, but you have to compute the percentages yourself.
- If the lesson is *"a 61% majority got spoiled,"* favor 100 (or a clean multiple). If the lesson is *"watch the two rounds add up,"* favor tens.

## Keep the built-in disambiguators on

- The **`×` count separator** (`40 × 5,5,0`) reads as "times" — leave it on (`count_separator: "×"`).
- The **`Count:` header** labels the weight column explicitly.
- The **runoff** and **score-distribution** numbers are vote *counts*; keep the total small enough that those stay checkable if you'll narrate them.

## Rules of thumb

1. **Never put a weighted count in 1–5.** Either switch to individual ballots, or use counts ≥ 6.
2. **Match the total to the story** — round numbers for percentages, small numbers for live arithmetic.
3. **Keep the scoring-round product easy** if you want the audience to verify it (count × top score should be a number they can do in their head).
4. **Be consistent within a lesson sequence**, so the *magnitude* doesn't become an extra variable the audience has to track from one example to the next.

## Worked feel for each style

- `01_Single_winner/00a_c2_b1_two-candidates.yaml` — **1 ballot**, individual. The gears, nothing else.
- `split_voting/01_political_left_split.yaml` — **100 voters**, weighted, counts 24/22/20/34 (all ≥ 6). Percentages are obvious; the spoiler story needs them.
- `01_Single_winner/equal_support_runoff_demo.yaml` — **100 voters** (40/35/25). Easy percentages; the trade-off is the `375` scoring total you don't ask the audience to verify.
- `split_voting/00_plurality_vs_majority.yaml` — **100 voters** (40/35/25). The textbook "proportions / majority story": the whole lesson is "40% wins the plurality but a 60% majority opposed," so the counts *are* the percentages. Large scoring totals (`Blake 275`) you read past — the point is the divergence, not the sums.
