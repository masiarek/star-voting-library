# Reporting true ties

**One line:** a **true tie** is when two candidates are genuinely equal at a step — same score, or an equal split in the runoff. This page is about how a tie **shows up in the reports**; the mechanics of *breaking* one (the full ladder, lot order, imported `tieBreakType`) are the canonical [STAR Tie-Breaking](../STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md) deep-dive.

## How a tie reads in the LH report

The engine marks the tied rows and says so in words, then resolves them by the tie-break ladder. A runoff that splits evenly:

```
[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Choco         -- 1 -- Tied for first place
   Vanilla       -- 1 -- Tied for first place
 There's a two-way tie for first.
```

— here broken by the **Scoring Round** (Vanilla had the higher total), exactly the ladder's first rung. (Worked end-to-end, with ties in *both* rounds: [Tie-Breaking — the Ice Cream example](../STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md#worked-example--ice-cream-6-flavors-ties-in-both-rounds).)

**Reporting detail:** on an **exact runoff tie** the one-line runoff-percentage summary (`Voters with a preference: …`) is **suppressed** — a 50/50 split has no "winner vs other" to state, so the **tie-break chain explains the result instead**. The percentage line returns only for a decided runoff.

## How a tie reads in BetterVoting

BetterVoting records how a tie was settled in its result data as **`tieBreakType`**, and shows the resolved order on the result card. (For how an imported BetterVoting tie-break maps into a YAML election's lot order, see [tie-break JSON](../STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking_JSON.md).)

     No BV tie election captured yet. To make one: create a tiny STAR election on
     BetterVoting whose runoff splits evenly (e.g. 2 voters, ballots `5,3,0` and
     `0,5,3` over Choco/Vanilla/Berry → a 1-1 runoff broken by the score round).

## Why ties feel common in tiny examples

Teaching elections use the **fewest ballots** that make a point, and small electorates tie easily (a 1–1 runoff needs just two voters). That's a feature for *showing* the tie-break ladder — and a reason real public elections, with thousands of ballots, almost never reach the lot-drawing floor.
