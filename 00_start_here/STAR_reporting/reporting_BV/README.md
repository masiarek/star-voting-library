# How BetterVoting reports a STAR result

**One line:** BetterVoting (bettervoting.com) shows a **live, visual** result — interactive bar/pie charts plus "Race Details" tables — for the same STAR election the LH engine prints as text. Same method, same winner; a friendlier, less exhaustive view.

→ Hub: [STAR Reporting](../) · the mapping in full: [BetterVoting and the LH engine](../../tabulation_engines/bettervoting_and_the_engine.md) · the percentages: [Runoff percentages](../../STAR_Voting/runoff_percentages.md).

## What BetterVoting shows

- **Scoring Round** — a bar chart of total stars; the top two bars are the finalists.
- **Automatic Runoff** — a chart with a **toggle**:
  - **bar view** uses the *all-voters* numbers (e.g. 42 / 38 / 20) with a dashed **majority-threshold** line labelled "½ of voters **with preference**";
  - **pie view** drops Equal Support and shows just the two finalists (52 / 48), footnoting the no-preference share.
- **Race Details tables** — a **Scores Table** (the score totals) and a **Runoff Table** with **two percent columns**:
  - **% Runoff Votes** — out of *all* ballots (includes the Equal Support share);
  - **% Between Finalists** — out of only the voters *with a preference*. This is the column that decides the race. (Same idea, named: [Runoff percentages](../../STAR_Voting/runoff_percentages.md).)
- **Abstentions / tally** — the result data carries `nAbstentions` and `nTallyVotes`.

## The screenshots (the pet race)

**Scoring Round + Automatic Runoff bars** — totals on the left; on the right each ballot's full vote goes to the higher-scored finalist, with the dashed *majority-threshold* line (½ of voters **with a preference**) that only the winner's bar crosses:

**Race Details tables** — the Scores Table and the Runoff Table, where the same 190 votes appear as **two percentages**: `% Runoff Votes` (out of all 455) and `% Between Finalists` (out of the 363 with a preference):

**Pie view** — the runoff toggled to drop Equal Support and show just the two finalists (52 / 48), footnoting the no-preference share:

(The same screenshots, walked through against the two denominators, are in [Runoff percentages](../../STAR_Voting/runoff_percentages.md).)

## One thing to watch: what BetterVoting calls an "abstention"

BetterVoting counts a ballot as an **abstention** when it is **flat** — every candidate scored the same — and excludes it from the tally. That includes an all-zeros ballot **and** an engaged ballot like all-5s or `3,3,3`. The LH engine instead counts every cast ballot and treats only a **blank** ballot as an abstention, filing flat ballots under **Equal Support**. Same winner, different tally and score totals — see [Where the two reports differ](../reporting_diff_BV_LH.md).
