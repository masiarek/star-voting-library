# Reading the Runoff Percentages — Two Denominators, One Winner

**One line:** in the Automatic Runoff, the *same* vote count is shown as **two
different percentages** — out of **all** voters, and out of only the voters who
**expressed a preference** between the two finalists. The winner needs a majority of
the second group, not the first. The gap between the two numbers is the **Equal
Support** voters, who scored both finalists the same.

→ Part of [The Automatic Runoff Round](STAR_Automatic_Runoff.md) (the round this
percentage summarizes). The no-preference bucket is [`Equal Support`](../GLOSSARY.md);
why those ballots still count is [Are equal-score votes discounted?](are_equal_score_votes_discounted.md).

## The example (the Dog/Cat race, 455 voters)

Seven candidates, Dog wins. The Scoring Round adds every star and takes the top two —
**Dog (1798)** and **Cat (1741)** — as Finalists. The Automatic Runoff then compares
*only those two*, giving each ballot's full vote to whichever of Dog/Cat it scored
higher. (Live, interactive version of the screenshots below:
[bettervoting.com/pet/results](https://bettervoting.com/pet/results).)

The runoff result is the same numbers no matter how you slice it:

| In the runoff | Votes | of **all 455** | of the **363 with a preference** |
|---------------|------:|---------------:|---------------------------------:|
| **Dog** (winner) | 190 | 42% | **52%** |
| Cat | 173 | 38% | 48% |
| **Equal Support** | 92 | 20% | — |
| Total | 455 | 100% | 100% |

That table is exactly BetterVoting's **Race Details** — the two percent columns are
"% Runoff Votes" (out of all 455) and "% Between Finalists" (out of the 363 with a
preference):

![BetterVoting Race Details: a Scores Table (Dog 1798 … Python 440) and a Runoff Table showing Dog 190 / 42% / 52%, Cat 173 / 38% / 48%, Equal Support 92 / 20%, Total 455 / 100% / 100%](img/pets_race_details_tables.png)

And the result card has two **chart views** (the toggle in its corner) — same runoff,
two ways of slicing it. The **bar view** above uses the all-voters numbers
(42 / 38 / 20) with the dashed *majority threshold*; the **pie view** drops Equal
Support and shows just the two finalists (52 / 48), footnoting the no-preference share:

## The two denominators

This is the whole lesson. **190 votes for Dog is both 42% and 52%** — nothing changed
but what you divide by.

- **% of all voters** = `190 / 455 = 42%`. Useful for one thing: it shows how big the
  no-preference group is. Here **20%** of voters rated Dog and Cat equally, so they had
  no say in *this* head-to-head. The three numbers add to 100%.
- **% between finalists** = `190 / 363 = 52%`. This is the number that **decides the
  race**. The Equal Support voters are set aside (they declined to pick between these
  two), leaving `455 − 92 = 363` voters with a preference. Of those, more chose Dog.
  Dog and Cat's two numbers add to 100%; Equal Support has no entry here — it's the
  group that was removed to form the denominator.

## Why the winner isn't "majority of everyone"

Notice Dog wins with **42% of all ballots** — *less* than half of everyone. That is
not a flaw, and it's why the bar chart's threshold line is labelled **"½ of voters
with preference,"** not ½ of all voters.

A runoff asks one question: *of the two finalists, which do more voters prefer?* A
voter who scored Dog and Cat the same has answered "neither — they're equal to me," so
counting them against either finalist would be putting words in their mouth. The
majority bar is therefore half of the **363** who actually expressed a preference:
`363 / 2 = 181.5`. Dog's **190 clears it**; Cat's 173 doesn't. Dog is the true majority
choice *of the voters who had a preference* — a real majority, honestly earned.

## Equal Support is not "discarded"

The 92 Equal Support voters counted **fully in the Scoring Round** — their stars are
*inside* Dog's 1798 and Cat's 1741, and helped make both of them finalists. They simply
didn't break the Dog-vs-Cat tie, **because their own ballots said the two were tied**.
They're excluded from the runoff *percentage* only, and only because they asked to be.
Nothing was thrown away; the voters chose to sit out one specific comparison. (Contrast
this with an IRV *exhausted* ballot, which stops counting because the method ran out of
ranks — a method-caused loss, not a voter's choice. See
[exhausted ballots](../RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_exhausted_ballots.md).)

## The same number in the LH engine

The `starvote` engine prints this decisive percentage on two lines — with the
denominator **named**, so there's no second column to misread. Turn it on with
`options: { show_runoff_percent: true }` (it's off by default, but the always-full
`_tabulated` copy carries it automatically):

```
Automatic Runoff Round
   Dog           -- 190 -- First place
   Cat           -- 173
   Equal Support -- 98
 Dog wins.
   Voters with a preference: 363 of 461 (98 Equal Support).
   Dog 190 (52%) vs Cat 173 (48%); majority = 182.
```

Those two lines are the **% Between Finalists** column, spelled out — and they now
*self-reconcile*: **363 of 461** voters had a preference, the other **98 are Equal
Support**, Dog's 190 is 52% of the 363, and a strict majority needs 182, which Dog clears.
(In the saved `_tabulated` copy this expands into a "Runoff math" funnel that shows
`461 − 98 = 363` explicitly.)

**Why 98 here but 92 in the BetterVoting table above (and 461 vs 455)?** Same ballots,
one classification difference: BetterVoting files 6 *flat* "no-preference" ballots —
including a voter who scored every candidate **5** — under *abstention* and tallies 455;
the LH engine counts all 461 cast ballots, so those 6 stay in Equal Support (`92 + 6 = 98`)
and only the 1 truly-blank ballot is an abstention. The **363 decided voters and the
winner are identical** either way. Full reconciliation:
[BetterVoting and the LH engine](../tabulation_engines/bettervoting_and_the_engine.md#when-the-two-reports-differ--abstentions-vs-equal-support)
and the frozen evidence in

rest of the engine output, and `CLAUDE.md` for the option's house default.)
