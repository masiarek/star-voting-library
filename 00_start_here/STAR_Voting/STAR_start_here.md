# STAR Voting — Lesson 0: Start Here (the "why" before the "how")

*The STAR on-ramp. For the repo's method-neutral entry point see
[`../00_START_HERE.md`](../00_START_HERE.md).*

Read this before showing any example. It gives the audience the background
that makes every later election make sense. (Feedback from a test run: people
get lost if you jump straight into a specific ballot without this.)

## The one-sentence pitch

**STAR Voting compresses today's two-election process into a single ballot.**

You score every candidate from 0 to 5, and the two highest-scoring candidates
automatically go head-to-head to decide the winner. That's the name:
**S**core **T**hen **A**utomatic **R**unoff.

## Why STAR exists: the spoiler effect

Our current "choose one" (plurality) voting is only accurate when there are
**exactly two candidates**. The moment a third candidate enters, votes split:
two similar candidates can divide their shared supporters and *both* lose to a
less-liked candidate the majority didn't want. That's the **spoiler effect**,
and it's why we feel pressure to vote "lesser evil" for the front-runner
instead of the candidate we actually like.

STAR fixes this. Because you score every candidate independently, adding more
good candidates never splits your vote — you can fully support your favorite
*and* a backup. Honesty becomes the best strategy.

> Keep this in mind for the examples: with **2 candidates** STAR and ordinary
> voting agree (plurality already works there). STAR's whole advantage shows up
> only with **3 or more** — which is exactly why our examples start at two
> (to learn the gears) and then add a third candidate (to see the point).

## Start from what people already know: we already vote in two rounds

Today, to handle a crowded field of candidates, we usually run **two separate
elections**:

1. A **primary** that narrows many candidates down to one or two finalists.
2. A **general election / runoff** that picks between those finalists.

That means two trips to the polls, two campaigns, and low-turnout primaries
that quietly decide who you even get to choose from in November.

**STAR does both jobs on one ballot:**

- **Round 1 — Scoring Round** (this is the "primary"): add up everyone's
  scores; the **top two** advance.
- **Round 2 — Automatic Runoff** (this is the "runoff"): of those two
  finalists, whoever is preferred on **more ballots** wins.

One ballot. One election. Two rounds of logic — done automatically.

## How to vote (the ballot rules)

The official Equal Vote Coalition guidance, in four lines:

- Give your **favorite** candidate **5 stars**.
- Give your **last choice 0 stars** (or leave it blank).
- **Equal scores are allowed.**
- **Score the other candidates as you wish**, anywhere from 0 to 5.

In the automatic runoff, if you scored both finalists the **same**, your ballot
counts as **"no preference"** (what this tool labels **Equal Support**) — a
5/5 means "either is great," a 0/0 means "I dislike both equally." If you do
have a preference, it's best to show it.

## Why TWO rounds and not just the scores? (the conceptual heart)

The cleanest way to explain it — the **dual nature** of STAR:

- **Scoring Round measures *how much* support** (strength). Add up the stars;
  the two strongest candidates become finalists.
- **Automatic Runoff measures *how many* supporters** (numbers). Each ballot
  goes to whichever finalist it scored higher; the finalist more voters
  preferred wins.

So round 1 asks "who are the real contenders?" and round 2 asks "between those
two, who do more voters actually prefer?"

Why both? If we only added up scores (pure score voting), voters are tempted to
"min-max" — give a 5 to their favorite and 0 to everyone else — and honest,
nuanced ballots lose to strategic ones. The automatic runoff fixes that by
re-checking real preference between the finalists, so honest scoring is safe and
the winner has genuine support, not just a passionate minority.

> Strength of support (how much) -> finds the finalists.
> Number of supporters (how many) -> decides between them.

**Equal scores still count in both rounds.** If you score the two finalists the
same, your ballot is "no preference" (Equal Support) in the runoff — but it was
fully counted in the scoring round and helped decide *which* candidates became
finalists. An equal-score ballot is never discarded.

---

## What else to mention up front

- **It's one ballot, not two trips to the polls.**
- **You can be honest.** Score your favorite a 5 *and* give a backup a 4 — you
  never split your own vote or "waste" it.
- **Equal scores are allowed.** You're not forced to rank or invent a
  difference you don't feel. (Two candidates can tie at 5.)
- **Vocabulary they'll see on screen:** score 0–5, finalists, head-to-head,
  "Equal Support" (a voter who scored both finalists the same).

## How to transition into the examples

End Lesson 0 with a promise and a map:

> "Let's watch those two rounds actually turn. We'll start on the smallest
> possible election so the gears are visible, then add a candidate and see why
> STAR matters."

**Roadmap (single-winner):**

| Step | Folder file | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 01a–c | `01_STAR/_main/01*` | **The mechanics.** 2 candidates — watch the two rounds turn. |
| 02a–b | `01_STAR/_main/02*` | **Why it matters.** Add a 3rd candidate; the winner becomes the broad compromise. |
| 03a–c | `01_STAR/_main/03*` | **How you're allowed to vote** — bullet votes, equal scores, low-score ballots, and the eight-style gallery (traditional / backup / partisan / ranked-style / "anyone but…"). Lesson: [`STAR_ballot_voting_styles.md`](STAR_ballot_voting_styles.md). |
| 04a–b | `01_STAR/_main/04*` | Display/analysis options (matrix, Condorcet). |
| 05a | `01_STAR/_main/05*` | Edge case: unanimous ballots. |
| 09 | `01_STAR/_main/09*` | The classic Tennessee capital example — the payoff. |

Then `02_STAR_Bloc/` and `03_STAR_PR/` for Bloc STAR and the proportional methods.

## The 2-candidate problem — read this, it'll save your demo

STAR's *value* only shows up with **3 or more candidates** (vote-splitting,
spoilers, and compromise winners need a crowd). With only two candidates, STAR
gives the same answer as ordinary voting. That's not a weakness of the
example — it's the **point** of starting there.

**Frame the 2-candidate lesson honestly as the mechanics warm-up:**

> "With only two candidates, STAR lands on the same winner as a normal
> election — and that's exactly why we start here. Nothing surprising competes
> for your attention, so you can watch the Scoring Round and the Automatic
> Runoff turn once, slowly. The interesting behavior starts the moment we add a
> third candidate."

Say that out loud and the let-down disappears: the audience knows they're
looking at the gears, not the payoff. Then the 3-candidate example (where the
winner flips to the compromise) hits harder *because* you set the baseline
first.

If you're short on time: spend ~60 seconds on 2 candidates purely to name the
two rounds, then move quickly to 3 candidates where the "aha" lives.
