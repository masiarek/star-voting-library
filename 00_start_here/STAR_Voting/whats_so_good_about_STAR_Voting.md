# What's So Good About STAR Voting?
### A recorded conversation — Larry (curious host) & Adam (expert)

A spoken, demo-driven conversation for a live recording. **Larry** asks the questions a smart newcomer would ask; **Adam** answers and drives the live demos. Cues in the margin:

- **[DEMO]** — run a file from this repo live on screen (the STAR engine).
- **[SLIDE]** — show a slide from one of the decks (see `README.md` for the map).
- **[REPO]** — a lesson file to pull language or framing from.

Pacing target: ~25–30 min. Each segment can also stand alone as a short clip.

## Segment 0 — Cold open (90 seconds)

**Larry:** Adam, you keep telling me STAR Voting is better. In one breath — what's so good about it?

**Adam:** Three things. You can finally vote your honest opinion without it backfiring. The winner actually has majority support. And anyone can re-add the count by hand. STAR does all three at once, and that combination is the whole story.

**Larry:** That's the trailer. Now make me believe it.

**Adam:** Deal. Let's start with the problem it fixes — because once you *feel* the problem, STAR stops looking clever and starts looking obvious.

## Segment 1 — The problem: vote splitting & the spoiler effect

**Larry:** Okay, what's actually broken about how we vote now?

**Adam:** Our Choose-One ballot is only accurate when there are exactly two candidates. The moment a third shows up, votes split. Two similar candidates can divide the people who like both of them, and a candidate the *majority* didn't want slips through the middle. That's the [spoiler effect](../topics/spoiler_effect.md).

**Larry:** Give me the cartoon version.

**Adam:** Star Wars. You expect Skywalker and Vader are the frontrunners, but you actually prefer Leia. If you vote your heart — Leia — you might "waste" your vote and help Vader win. So you hold your nose and vote Skywalker. Multiply that across millions of people and you get our whole political mess: lesser-evil voting, gate-kept candidates, and two parties that demonize each other.

**Larry:** Can you *show* me a spoiler, not just describe one?

**Adam:** Let's run a real election.

> [DEMO] `split_voting/01_political_left_split.yaml` — a 66% coalition (Green, Labour, SocialDem) splits three ways; under Choose-One the **Conservative wins with 34%**, a candidate two-thirds ranked last. The `[Vote-splitting check]` block says it in numbers. Then point out: *STAR elects Labour* — the coalition's consensus. [SLIDE] Full Deck — "PROBLEM: VOTE-SPLITTING" and "VOTE-SPLITTING SETS OFF A DOMINO EFFECT."

**Adam (after the demo):** Notice what just happened. Nobody was dishonest. The majority just got divided and conquered by their own ballot. That's not a freak event — it can happen in *any* race with more than two candidates.

## Segment 2 — Ranks vs Scores (the key conceptual move)

**Larry:** People say "just use Ranked Choice." Isn't ranking already more expressive than picking one?

**Adam:** It's more expressive than Choose-One, yes. But there's a deeper fork in the road here, and it's the thing most people never get told: there are two *families* of better ballots — **ranked** and **scored** ([the core distinction](../scores_and_ranks/scores_vs_ranks.md)) — and they're not the same tool.

**Larry:** What's the difference, concretely?

**Adam:** Ranking gives you *order only*: 1st, 2nd, 3rd. You can't say two candidates are equally good, and you can't say your 1st is a mile ahead while your 2nd and 3rd are basically tied. Scoring — rating each candidate 0 to 5, like stars on a movie — gives you order *plus intensity*, and it lets you mark equals.

**Larry:** Why does intensity matter? Order seems like enough.

**Adam:** Because elections are about finding the candidate who best represents everyone, and "how much" is real information. "She's my 2nd choice and I love her" and "he's my 2nd choice and he's the lesser evil" are completely different statements — and a ranked ballot writes them down *identically*. A scored ballot keeps the difference. More information in means a more representative winner out.

**Larry:** So scores are a superset of ranks?

**Adam:** Essentially — from a score ballot you can always read off the ranking, but from a ranking you can never recover the scores. That's why STAR uses a score ballot as its raw material.

> [SLIDE] Full Deck — "INTRODUCING: ALTERNATIVE VOTING! (Rating vs Ranking)" and "That changed with the invention of STAR Voting… Score + Instant Runoff." [REPO] `00_start_here/GLOSSARY.md` — "Scored (cardinal)" vs "Ranked (ordinal)."

## Segment 3 — The STAR ballot: how you actually vote

**Larry:** Walk me through filling one out.

**Adam:** Four rules, that's it:
- Give your favorite(s) **5 stars**.
- Give your last choice(s) **0**, or leave them blank.
- **[Equal scores are allowed](STAR_Scoring_Round.md)** — rate two candidates the same if you feel the same.
- Score everyone else anywhere from 0 to 5, however you like.

**Larry:** And if I only like one candidate?

**Adam:** Then "bullet vote" — give them 5 and leave the rest blank. STAR lets you. It's just not usually your strongest move, because the rest of your ballot is where you get a say in who the finalists are.

**Larry:** It feels suspiciously easy.

**Adam:** That's the point — it's the five-star rating everyone already does for movies and rideshares. Low error rates, no "I accidentally spoiled my ballot," and nothing gets thrown away.

## Segment 4 — The two rounds (the dual nature)

**Larry:** STAR stands for Score Then Automatic Runoff. What are the two steps?

**Adam:** You vote once; the count happens in two rounds.
- **[Scoring Round](STAR_Scoring_Round.md):** add up all the stars. The two highest-scoring candidates become finalists.
- **[Automatic Runoff](STAR_Automatic_Runoff.md):** for those two finalists, your ballot counts as a full vote for whichever one you scored higher. Whoever more voters preferred wins.

**Larry:** Why two rounds? Why not just elect the highest total score?

**Adam:** Because pure score has a weakness: if all that mattered was the total, some voters would be tempted to exaggerate — give their favorite a 5 and everyone else a 0. The runoff is the antidote. In the runoff the *size* of your score doesn't matter, only which finalist you put higher. So exaggerating can backfire — you might hand the runoff to someone you'd have preferred to influence.

**Larry:** So the two rounds are doing two different jobs.

**Adam:** Exactly — that's the [dual nature](STAR_hybrid_nature.md). The Scoring Round measures **how much** support there is — candidate quality, strength. The runoff measures **how many** supporters — number of people, a real majority. One finds the genuine contenders; the other decides between them by majority. Strength, then numbers.

**Larry:** Can you show the two rounds turning, slowly, on something tiny?

**Adam:** The smallest election possible.

> [DEMO] `01_Single_winner/00a_c2_b1_two-candidates.yaml` — one voter, two flavors. Watch the Scoring Round, then the Automatic Runoff. With two candidates STAR agrees with ordinary voting — that's *why* we start here: the gears are visible, nothing surprising competes for attention. [DEMO] Then `01_Single_winner/vote_splitting2.yaml` (or `split_voting/02…`) — add a third candidate and watch the winner become the broad compromise. [SLIDE] Full Deck — "HOW DOES STAR VOTING WORK?" and "STAR RESULTS: 1) Add up the stars. 2) Add up the votes." [REPO] `00_start_here/00_START_HERE.md` — "Why TWO rounds and not just scores?"

**Adam (tie-in):** There's a lovely way the core Python developer Tim Peters put it: STAR treats your scores as *numbers* to pick the finalists, then treats the same scores as mere *order* to decide the runoff. The big "5" is decisive in step one and irrelevant in step two — and that's exactly what makes it hard to game.

## Segment 5 — Why this is better: the benefits

**Larry:** Sell me the upside in a list I can remember.

**Adam:** Equal Vote uses five yardsticks — Simple, Honest, Expressive, Accurate, Equal — and STAR is built to hit all five:
- **Honest:** it's safe to give your true favorite a 5. No favorite betrayal.
- **Expressive:** you show both order *and* degree, and you can mark equals.
- **Accurate:** in the satisfaction studies, STAR tops the charts — it collects the best data and then *uses all of it*. No ballot is wasted or ignored.
- **Equal:** every voter has the identical 0–5 range for every candidate, and an equal vote in both rounds. It eliminates vote-splitting, which is the thing that makes some voters' votes count less.
- **Simple:** five stars to vote, addition to count.

**Larry:** And counting?

**Adam:** This is the sleeper feature. STAR is **[precinct-summable](STAR_summability.md)** — each precinct reports its score totals and a small for/equal/against table, and you just add precincts together. No shipping every ballot to one central computer. That means fast results, easy audits, and it works with paper ballots and vote- by-mail. Any citizen can re-add the numbers.

## Segment 6 — STAR vs RCV-IRV (the honest comparison)

**Larry:** Ranked Choice Voting is the one people have heard of. How is STAR different — and be fair, what does RCV do *well*?

**Adam:** Fair is the right instinct. [RCV-IRV](../RCV_IRV/RCV-IRV-Hare.md) is a real improvement over Choose-One, and where there are only two viable candidates it cleanly kills the old "Nader" spoiler. Credit where due. But it has structural problems that STAR doesn't, and they show up exactly in the competitive races that matter most.

**Larry:** Name the big ones.

**Adam:** Three:
1. **It doesn't count all your rankings.** RCV-IRV only ever looks at your top *remaining* choice each round. If your favorite is eliminated, your next choice is counted — but only sometimes, depending on the order of elimination. Lots of marked rankings are simply never read.
2. **[Exhausted ballots](../RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_exhausted_ballots.md).** When your ranked candidates are all eliminated, your ballot is discarded. On average around 10–11% of ballots aren't counted in the deciding round of competitive races, so the "majority winner" is often a majority of *remaining* ballots, not of voters.
3. **[Center squeeze](../RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_center_squeeze.md).** A broadly-liked moderate can be eliminated early precisely because few people rank them *first* — and the polarizing candidate the majority actually opposed wins. That's the spoiler effect sneaking back in.

**Larry:** Do you have a real election, not a thought experiment?

**Adam:** Two famous ones.
- **[Burlington, Vermont, 2009](../topics/spoiler_effect.md#a-real-irv-spoiler--burlington-2009):** Montroll was preferred head-to-head over *both* opponents — the candidate the majority actually wanted — but he had fewer first-choice votes, so RCV-IRV eliminated him early and Kiss won. The city repealed RCV-IRV afterward.
- **[Alaska 2022 special](../RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_alaska_2022.md):** Begich would have beaten either opponent head-to-head, but the two Republicans split and Begich was eliminated; Peltola won and the seat flipped. Voters who ranked Palin first effectively helped elect their last choice — favorite betrayal, live.

**Larry:** So how does STAR avoid all that?

**Adam:** Because the score ballot lets you fully support everyone on your side at once — the coalition doesn't split — and STAR counts *every* ballot in *both* rounds. Nothing is exhausted, nothing is ignored. And it's summable, which RCV-IRV structurally is not: RCV-IRV needs every ballot in one place to know the elimination order, so you can't tally precincts independently or report meaningful early results.

**Larry:** Give me the one-card scorecard.

**Adam:**

| | Choose-One | RCV (IRV) | STAR |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spoiler / vote-splitting? | Yes | Yes, with 3+ viable | **No** |
| Wasted / exhausted ballots? | Yes | Yes (~11% avg) | **No** |
| Summable / local tally? | Yes | **No** | **Yes** |
| Accuracy (voter satisfaction) | ~72–86% | ~80–91% | **~91–98%** |
| Strategy incentive | strong | weak | **lowest** |

**Larry:** And the honest caveat?

**Adam:** No method is perfect — that's a theorem, not an opinion (Gibbard). STAR isn't strategy-*proof*, just strongly strategy-*resistant*. And it's not formally Condorcet-compliant — very rarely it won't elect the pairwise winner. But when it diverges, it's choosing a candidate with broad, strong support over a weakly-liked compromise ([three notions of "winner"](STAR_three_winner_notions.md)) — and that's a defensible philosophical call, not a bug. Saying that out loud is what earns you the room.

## Segment 7 — Wrap & call to action

**Larry:** Bring it home. Why should I care today?

**Adam:** Because the ballot is upstream of everything — polarization, money in politics, who even gets to run. Fix the ballot and you loosen all of it. STAR is the simplest change that lets you vote your conscience, guarantees a real majority winner, and stays easy to count and trust. It's the next generation of voting reform, and you can try it in about thirty seconds.

**Larry:** Where?

**Adam:** Go to **BetterVoting.com** and cast a STAR ballot right now. Bring it to your next club, board, or HOA vote — that's how it spreads. And dig into the science at **equal.vote/accuracy** and **equal.vote/star-vs-rcv**.
