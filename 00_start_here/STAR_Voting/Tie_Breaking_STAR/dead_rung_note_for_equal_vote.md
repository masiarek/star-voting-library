# The "dead rung" in STAR's official tiebreaker ladder

All examples below are engine-verified and reproducible; the runnable files are listed at the end.*

## Summary

The official STAR tiebreaker protocol uses a **five-star count** as its second rung in both rounds: still-tied candidates are compared by how many **maximum** scores they received. The rung counts the **scale's** max (literally `score == 5`), not the highest score any voter actually used. When none of the tied candidates earned a single 5, the rung still runs — but reads `0–0`, separates nobody, and the tie falls straight through to random resolution. We call this a **dead rung**. It is not exotic: cautious electorates, small informal polls, and data rescaled onto a coarse range routinely produce ballots that top out at 4. In exactly the elections where ties are most likely (small ones), the ladder is effectively one rung shorter than it looks, and the lot decides earlier and more often than the protocol's length suggests.

## The protocol as we implement it

```
SCORING ROUND — choose the two finalists
  1. PAIRWISE    — most head-to-head wins among the tied
  2. FIVE-STAR   — most score-5 votes
  3. LOT         — pre-drawn random order (last resort)

AUTOMATIC RUNOFF — choose the winner
  1. SCORE       — higher total score
  2. FIVE-STAR   — most score-5 votes
  3. LOT
```

## The minimal pair

The same two-ballot standoff, one point apart. Both verified against our tabulation engine (a fork of Larry Hastings' `starvote`):

```
 A FIVE EXISTS — rung fires                NO FIVES — dead rung, lot decides
   Ann,Ben                                   Ann,Ben
   5,1                                       4,0
   0,4                                       0,4

 Head-to-head 1–1; scores 5–5.             Head-to-head 1–1; scores 4–4.
 Five-star: Ann 1, Ben 0 → ANN wins.       Five-star: 0–0 → the LOT decides.
```

One point of enthusiasm is the difference between "the ballots decided" and "a coin flip decided." A subtler variant: if both candidates have the *same nonzero* number of 5s, the rung fires, counts real votes, and still decides nothing — equal counts fall through exactly like `0–0`.

A related scale effect: on a 0–9 ballot the same rung is a *nine-star* count. We reconstructed a published 0–9 teaching example (four elections) on our 0–5 engine and found a 5.6-vs-5.4 score distinction that no 0–5 rescaling can express — coarse scales both create ties and starve the rung that is supposed to break them.

## A possible refinement: walk down the rungs

A natural generalization: if the five-star counts tie, compare **four-star** counts, then three-star, and so on — equivalently, compare the tied candidates' score distributions lexicographically from the top. Properties worth noting:

- **Backward compatible in outcome** wherever the current rule decides: it is identical to five-star whenever five-star separates the candidates.
- **Still precinct-summable** — it needs only the per-candidate score histogram the count already produces.
- **Nearly eliminates random resolution**: the lot is reached only when the tied candidates' entire score distributions are identical, which at any real scale essentially means a genuinely perfect tie.
- **Cost**: a longer rule to state and certify, and a spec change for every implementation (BetterVoting included). "Most 5s" is easy to say out loud; "lexicographic histogram comparison" is not, even if "if 5s tie, compare 4s, then 3s…" states it plainly enough for statute.

## What we do, and what we're asking

Our library follows the **official protocol unchanged** — compatibility with Equal Vote's specification and BetterVoting's counts matters more to an education project than a marginally better tiebreaker. But we document the dead rung explicitly and guard it with nine engine-verified test elections, five of which set the lot order *adversarially* so the tests fail if an implementation consults the lot before exhausting the deterministic rungs.

Perspective: at public-election scale, ties that survive pairwise/score AND five-star are vanishingly rare — this note is not an alarm. But BetterVoting's bread and butter includes exactly the small polls where dead rungs are common.

Two questions for Equal Vote:

1. Is "scale max, not field max" the intended reading of the five-star rung? (Our engine implements it that way; BetterVoting appears to as well.)
2. Has a walk-down-the-rungs variant been considered for a future protocol revision — and if it was considered and rejected, we'd gladly document the reasoning.
