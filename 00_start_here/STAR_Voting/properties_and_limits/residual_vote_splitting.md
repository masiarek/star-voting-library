# STAR's Residual Vote-Splitting

**One line:** STAR removes the *forced* vote-splitting that wrecks Choose-One — you can score two similar candidates both high, so running an ally doesn't bleed your support. What survives is a **narrow, self-inflicted** residual in the top-two runoff: a faction can still split itself if it refuses to use the score ballot, or tries to game which ally claims the second finalist slot.

## Why STAR kills the ordinary spoiler

Choose-One forces every voter to name **one** candidate, so two similar candidates mechanically divide their shared support and a minority can slip through. STAR's **scoring round** removes that: a coalition voter gives Ada a 5 *and* ally Ben a 4, so Ben's presence costs Ada nothing. Add a clone, lose nothing. That is the whole spoiler-resistance pitch, and it is real.

## Where the residual lives — the top-two runoff

Only the **two highest score totals** advance to the automatic runoff. That single fact is the only place a split can sneak back, and it takes voter behavior to trigger it. Two flavors:

**1. Self-inflicted split (bullet-voting).** If a faction tribally bullet-votes — Ada-fans give ally Ben a 0, Ben-fans give Ada a 0 — they divide their own score totals, and the opponent can grab a finalist slot on the split field. Nothing about the electorate's true preferences caused this; the voters declined to express the support they actually feel. The cure is on the ballot: score your ally even a 3 and the split vanishes.

**2. The "chicken dilemma" (strategic).** When two allies both could make the runoff, each wing has a *tiny* incentive to under-score the other ally so that *their* favorite, not the ally, claims the second seat. If only one wing does it, it may work; if **both** do it, they knock their shared side down and hand the seat to the opponent. It needs accurate polling and coordination, and it **backfires when you guess wrong**.

## Minimal test case — run the matched pair

Same three candidates and the same true preferences; only the *expressiveness* changes (60 voters on the Ada/Ben side, 40 for opponent Cara):

| File | Ada/Ben behavior | Scores (Ada / Ben / Cara) | STAR winner |
|------|------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| [05a](../../../method_comparisons/split_voting/_main/_main_pages/05a_residual_split_bullet-voting.md) | bullet-vote (ally = 0) | 175 / 125 / **200** | **Cara** (minority) — split not rescued |
| [05b](../../../method_comparisons/split_voting/_main/_main_pages/05b_residual_split_expressive-fix.md) | score ally a 3 | **250** / 230 / 200 | **Ada** (majority side) — split fixed |

In 05a the engine's `[Vote-splitting check]` is honest: it flags the majority coalition, then reports *"STAR elected Cara"* — STAR does **not** paper over a split the voters inflicted on themselves. In 05b, `[Divergence from STAR]` shows Choose-One still electing Cara while STAR diverges and keeps the seat on the majority side.

## Why it's a narrow edge case, not the spoiler all over again

- **The ordinary spoiler is automatic** — no one has to coordinate or even intend it: under Choose-One the split happens *on its own* whenever similar candidates run (whether it actually flips the winner then depends on the margins). Splitting is the *default*, not a strategy someone has to execute.
- **STAR's residual is the exception** — it needs a near-tie for the second runoff slot, accurate prediction, coordinated mis-scoring, and it **backfires if you're wrong**. The [brute-force simulation](../../../06_Other/simulations/README.md) finds that a favorite-betrayal-style play in STAR helps only ~2% of the time it changes the result — it backfires ~98% of the time. So honest, expressive scoring stays your safest ballot.

Same root cause as STAR's [favorite-betrayal](favorite_betrayal_voting_301.md) and [center-squeeze](../../RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_center_squeeze.md) edge cases: all three come from "only the top two advance."

## How to say it honestly

Not *"STAR eliminates vote-splitting"* (full stop) but *"STAR ends forced vote-splitting and shrinks the rest to a narrow, hard-to-coordinate, backfire-prone edge case — dramatically reduces, doesn't claim to eliminate."* The honest version is still the winning version.

This is the same discipline the rest of the library applies to every claim: concede the real limit, then make the (still strong) accurate case. See [STAR's honest limits](STAR_honest_limits.md) for the full set, and — for the mirror image, *our own side's* overclaims about the other methods — the ["claims our own side oversells"](../../RCV_IRV/rcv_irv_false_claims.md#the-mirror-claims-our-own-side-oversells-about-irv) section. "Dramatically reduces, doesn't eliminate" is exactly the honest register that keeps the whole case credible.
