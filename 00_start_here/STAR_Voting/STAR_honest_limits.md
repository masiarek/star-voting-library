# STAR Voting — Honest Limits

**One line:** STAR is strong but **not perfect**. It is not Condorcet-compliant, not
favorite-betrayal-proof, gives up Later-No-Harm by design, leaves a narrow residual of
vote-splitting, and — like *every* method (Gibbard) — can be gamed at the margins. None of
these are secret; conceding them honestly is why the rest of the case is trustworthy.

## 1. Not Condorcet-compliant

STAR can fail to elect the **Condorcet winner** (the candidate who beats every other one
head-to-head). Its runoff is between the *top two by score*, and the Condorcet winner can
be a close third on score and never reach the runoff. **How much it matters:** simulations
put STAR's Condorcet-efficiency very high, and when it diverges the STAR winner is someone
with very broad support who lost one pairing narrowly. It's a **tradeoff**, not a clean
loss — Condorcet methods buy compliance by sometimes electing a weakly-supported compromise
nobody is enthusiastic about. See [three notions of "winner"](./STAR_three_winner_notions.md).

## 2. Not favorite-betrayal-proof (rare)

STAR does **not** satisfy the Favorite-Betrayal Criterion: in rare, knife-edge
constructions a voter can do better by scoring a front-runner above their true favorite.
**How much it matters:** it takes precise knowledge and coordination, and honest scoring is
almost always the best strategy — but "eliminates favorite betrayal" would be an overclaim.
Neither STAR nor RCV-IRV is FBC-proof (they fail it in different ways). See
[favorite betrayal](favorite_betrayal_voting_301.md).

## 3. Gives up Later-No-Harm (by design)

Scoring your second choice can help that candidate **beat your favorite** in the runoff.
This is a genuine tradeoff, not an oversight: Later-No-Harm and the Favorite-Betrayal
Criterion are provably incompatible with other things we want, so STAR deliberately keeps
favorite-betrayal resistance and gives up Later-No-Harm. RCV-IRV makes the opposite choice.

## 4. Residual vote-splitting / the chicken dilemma

STAR ends *forced* vote-splitting, but a **narrow, self-inflicted** residue remains: two
allied candidates' supporters can bullet-vote against each other (the "chicken dilemma").
**How much it matters:** it's hard to coordinate and usually self-defeating, far smaller
than Choose-One's structural splitting — but non-zero. Full treatment:
[residual vote-splitting](./residual_vote_splitting.md).

## 5. Strategic scoring / normalization

The 0–5 ballot invites **min-maxing** — giving 5s and 0s rather than honest intermediate
scores — because an exaggerated ballot can carry more weight in the scoring round. STAR's
automatic runoff dampens this (your honest order still decides the final round), but doesn't
erase it. Gibbard's theorem guarantees **no** method with 3+ candidates is fully
strategy-proof; STAR aims for *resistant, not proof*.

## 6. The ballot has a learning curve

A 0–5 grid is more to explain than "pick one," and some voters under-use the scale (only 0s
and 5s), losing expressiveness. It's still a familiar five-star pattern, but it is more
cognitive load than plurality and a legitimate adoption hurdle.

## 7. Tie-breaking is more machinery

Resolving ties runs a chain (pairwise → most five-star scores → lot), which is more moving
parts than "most votes wins." Rare in large electorates, but real complexity to specify and
explain. See [tie-breaking](./Tie_Breaking_STAR/).

## Keep it in perspective

Every method trades something away — that's Arrow and Gibbard, not a STAR-specific flaw.
The honest comparison is *which* tradeoffs, and how often they bite. STAR's limits are
mostly rare edge cases or deliberate, well-motivated choices; its opponents' (and peers')
limits are laid out just as plainly on the companion pages above, so you can judge the
whole board rather than one square.
