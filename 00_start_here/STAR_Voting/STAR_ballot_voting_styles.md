# Filling Out the 5-Star Ballot — Voting Styles

*There is no wrong way to fill out a STAR ballot. This page is the gallery of legal styles — from a plain old choose-one vote to a fully expressive spread — and what each one actually says to the count.*

---

STAR uses a **5-star ballot**: you give every candidate an independent score from 0 to 5, like rating movies. Two facts do most of the work on this page:

- **Equal scores are allowed.** Two candidates can both get a 5 (or a 0). You're never forced to invent a difference you don't feel.
- **Skipping is allowed.** A candidate you leave blank simply counts as 0. You can't spoil the ballot by skipping, doubling, or "over-voting."

Because each score stands alone, filling the ballot out is quick: give your favorite a 5, your least favorite a 0, then place everyone else relative to those two. You never have to hold the whole field in your head at once — even in a 20-candidate race you're only ever comparing a candidate against your two anchors. (Contrast a ranked ballot, where each slot means re-scanning everyone you haven't ranked yet.)

## The style gallery — eight voters, eight legal ballots

Same six candidates for every voter: **Allen, Bianca, Chris, Desi, Edith, Frank**. Each row below is one voter's complete, valid ballot.

| Style | Allen | Bianca | Chris | Desi | Edith | Frank | What the voter is saying |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|---|
| **Traditional (choose-one)** | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | "Bianca. Period." — the familiar single-choice vote, transplanted. |
| **Strong backup** | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | "Bianca — and if not her, Frank is nearly as good." |
| **Weak backup** | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | "Bianca — and Frank only over the rest, reluctantly." |
| **Partisan slate** | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | "My party's three candidates, full support; nobody else." |
| **Ranked-style** | 2 | 5 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 4 | "I'll use each score once, like a ranking: B > F > D > A > E > C." |
| **Nuanced** | 3 | 4 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 5 | "Full range, and Allen = Desi because I truly can't split them." |
| **"Anyone but…"** | 5 | 5 | 0 | 5 | 5 | 5 | "Anyone but Chris." |
| **Protest / least-bad** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | "I dislike them all; Frank is the least bad." |

Every one of these is legal, and every one is counted. A few are worth a second look:

- **Traditional / choose-one** works exactly as the voter intends — but it's a bullet vote, and it under-uses the ballot: if Bianca doesn't reach the runoff, this ballot has no say in the final head-to-head. (The dedicated small demo: [`03a_c3_b3_style-bullet-vote.yaml`](../../01_STAR/_main/03a_c3_b3_style-bullet-vote.yaml).)
- **Backups are free.** The strong-backup and weak-backup ballots are the everyday super-power of a scored ballot: supporting a second choice can never hurt your first choice in the scoring round — a 5 is a 5 no matter what else you mark. (Honest fine print: the runoff compares your two scores, so *if both* end up finalists, your 4 says "prefer Bianca, but Frank is fine." That's the message the voter chose to send. See [STAR's honest limits](STAR_honest_limits.md).)
- **Ranked-style is legal but never required.** Using each score exactly once mimics a ranking. STAR reads it happily — but you've volunteered a constraint the ballot doesn't impose. The nuanced ballot right below it carries *more* honest information (equal 3s where the voter is truly indifferent) with *less* effort.
- **Partisan and "anyone but" ballots score equal 5s** — and that's fine. If two of those 5s become the finalists, the ballot is **Equal Support** in the runoff: no preference between the finalists, by the voter's own choice. It still counted fully in the scoring round, where it helped decide *who* the finalists were. An equal-score ballot is never discarded.
- **The protest vote still works.** All 0s and a single 1 registers a least-bad preference and can decide a race. Caveat: compressing your scores into the bottom of the range also shrinks your voice in the scoring round — a least-bad choice counts, but the full range counts louder.

## All eight styles in one election

The gallery above is a real, tabulatable election: [`03c_c6_b8_style-gallery.yaml`](../../01_STAR/_main/03c_c6_b8_style-gallery.yaml). Bianca and Frank reach the runoff on scores; Bianca wins it 4–2, with the partisan and "anyone but Chris" voters counted as Equal Support (they scored both finalists 5):

```
Scoring Round
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Bianca        -- 34 -- First place
   Frank         -- 25 -- Second place
   Allen         -- 15
   Desi          -- 11
   Edith         --  7
   Chris         --  0
 Bianca and Frank advance.

Automatic Runoff Round
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Bianca        -- 4 -- First place
   Frank         -- 2
   Equal Support -- 2
 Bianca wins.
   Voters with a preference: 6 of 8 (2 Equal Support).
   Bianca 4 (67%) vs Frank 2 (33%); majority = 4.

## Blanks, and what they mean

Leaving a candidate's line blank counts as **0** — always, with no penalty to the rest of the ballot. In this library's YAML files a blank is written `-`, and there are markers for the other real-world cases (race abstention `~`, candidate abstention `&`, spoiled `?`, spoiled-and-reissued `%`) — all tabulate as 0 but are reported honestly. See [Ballot & Terminology Basics](../ballot_and_terminology_basics.md) and the [GLOSSARY](../GLOSSARY.md).

Contrast RCV-IRV: skipped or repeated rankings are, in many jurisdictions, ballot *errors* — one reason reported spoilage runs roughly **4–9% for ranked ballots vs. 0–2% for rated ballots** (and 1–4% for the familiar single-mark ballot). A scored ballot is very hard to fill out wrong.

## Why the 5-star ballot earns its keep

**Expressive.** A choose-one ballot carries one bit of your opinion; an approval ballot, one yes/no per candidate; a ranked ballot, order but never strength. The 0–5 ballot carries order *and* strength — "Bianca by a mile" and "Bianca by a hair" are finally different votes. Six levels (0–5) sits near the sweet spot: enough resolution to matter, few enough that every step means something.

**Accurate.** Research comparing ratings and rankings finds ratings have superior validity — forced full rankings capture *noise*, differences voters don't actually feel. Equal scores let voters express exactly the distinctions that matter to them and no more. (The deep dive: [Scores vs. Ranks](../scores_and_ranks/scores_vs_ranks.md).)

**Equal.** Any way you fill out your ballot, someone else can fill theirs out in the equal and opposite way — no style has secret extra weight. That's the [Equally Weighted Vote](equally_weighted_vote.md), and it's why the gallery above is safe to publish as a how-to: there is no trick style to teach.
