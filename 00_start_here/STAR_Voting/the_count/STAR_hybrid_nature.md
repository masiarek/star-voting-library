# STAR's Hybrid Nature — Expressive Scoring + a Majority Runoff

**One line:** STAR is deliberately a *hybrid*. It takes the **expressiveness** of a score ballot (say *how much* you like each candidate, not just an order) and pairs it with the **legitimacy** of a majority runoff (the winner is the one more voters actually prefer between the top two). Score to find the finalists; majority to pick the winner.

In the formal language of the field, that means STAR combines a **cardinal** ballot (scores — *how much*) with an **ordinal** decision (the head-to-head runoff — *which one*). As Clelland (2023) puts it, STAR is *"a combination of cardinal and ordinal voting systems,"* first introduced in 2014 — ([arXiv:2303.00108](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00108); she uses it to explain why STAR gave a robust result on the [Alaska 2022 ballots](../../../method_comparisons/alaska_2022/README.md) where pure-cardinal Approval did not).

## The two steps, in plain language

**STAR = Score Then Automatic Runoff.**

1. **[Scoring Round](STAR_Scoring_Round.md).** Score each candidate from **0 to 5 stars**, like rating products online. Add up everyone's stars. The **two highest-scoring candidates** become the **Finalists**.
2. **[Automatic Runoff](STAR_Automatic_Runoff.md).** Now compare *only* those two finalists. Each ballot counts as one full vote for whichever finalist it scored higher. The finalist preferred by **more voters wins**.

Two steps, both things you can do on paper, and nothing is thrown away: every ballot is read in full, in both rounds.

## Why combine the two ideas?

Each "pure" approach has a known weakness; STAR's hybrid covers both.

- **Pure scoring (Approval / Score Voting)** is wonderfully expressive, but with only a sum it can hand the win to a candidate **adored by a passionate minority** over one **liked by a majority** — intensity can outvote numbers.
- **Pure majority / ranked methods** respect numbers, but a bare ranking throws away *how much* you prefer one candidate to the next, and (in the case of RCV-IRV) the elimination machinery brings its own [pathologies](../../RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_non_monotonicity.md).

STAR's move is to **use each idea for the job it's good at**: scores *measure support* and surface the two genuine front-runners; the runoff then applies a *majority check* so the winner can't be a minority-intense pick. You get strength-of-support **and** a majority finish on a single, simple ballot.

In the vocabulary of [what makes a "good" winner](../../topics/what_makes_a_good_winner.md), that's a deliberate **blend of two ideals**: the scoring round targets the **utilitarian** winner (highest total support — the broadly-liked candidate), and the automatic runoff confirms it against the **majority** winner (preferred head-to-head). Score to nominate; majority to decide. Neither pure ideal alone lands there — which is the whole point of the hybrid.

## The hybrid in one tiny election

Five voters, three flavors:

```
  Almond  Brownie  Cocoa
    5       1        2      ×1
    4       5        0      ×2     (collapsed: appears twice)
```

→ run [`runoff_overturns_leader/01a_c3_b3_more-stars-fewer-voters.yaml`](../../../01_STAR/runoff_overturns_leader/01a_c3_b3_more-stars-fewer-voters.yaml)

- **Scoring Round** finds the finalists: Almond (13 stars) and Brownie (11).
- **Automatic Runoff** picks the winner: 2 of 3 voters prefer **Brownie**, so Brownie wins 2–1 — even though Almond had more total stars.

That's the hybrid working as designed: scores *nominated* the two finalists; the majority runoff *chose* between them. Neither half alone would land there — pure score would crown Almond, and a method with no scores couldn't tell that Brownie was the broadly-liked compromise.

## Where this leads

- When the scoring leader and the runoff winner **differ**, that's [**Runoff Reversal**](../../../01_STAR/runoff_overturns_leader/) — the most important consequence of the hybrid design.
- When **Condorcet, Score, and Runoff** point at three different candidates, see [Three notions of "winner"](../properties_and_limits/STAR_three_winner_notions.md).
