# RCV-IRV (BTR) — Bottom-Two-Runoff

*An instant-runoff variant that fixes center squeeze: each round, the **two lowest** candidates meet head-to-head and the **loser** is eliminated. Because a Condorcet winner beats everyone, BTR can never eliminate them.*

## In one line

Like [Hare](../RCV-IRV-Hare.md), BTR eliminates one candidate per round and transfers ballots — but instead of cutting whoever has the fewest first choices, it takes the **two candidates with the fewest** and **eliminates the one who loses their direct head-to-head**. This one change makes it **Condorcet-efficient**: it always elects the candidate who beats every other one-on-one, when such a candidate exists.

## How the count works, step by step

1. Tally first choices (with transfers from any prior rounds).
2. Find the **two candidates with the fewest** votes.
3. Compare *those two* **head-to-head** across all ballots; **eliminate the loser**.
4. Transfer the loser's ballots to next choices; repeat from step 1 until one remains.

The intuition: Hare can eliminate a strong candidate just because few people rank them *first*. BTR only ever eliminates a candidate who **loses a head-to-head** — and the Condorcet winner loses none, so they survive to the end.

## Worked example — the same 27-voter squeeze

```
12  Left   > Center > Right
 9  Right  > Center > Left
 6  Center > Left   > Right
```

First choices: Left 12, Right 9, **Center 6**.

- **Two lowest:** Center (6) and Right (9). Head-to-head **Center vs Right**: Center is ranked above Right on 18 ballots, Right above Center on 9 → **Center wins, Right is eliminated.** (Hare would have cut Center here instead.)
- Right's 9 ballots go to **Center** → Center 15, Left 12.
- Final pair **Center vs Left**: Center 15, Left 12 → **Center wins.**

Same ballots as the [Hare page](../RCV-IRV-Hare.md), opposite result: BTR elects **Center**, the Condorcet winner. No center squeeze.

## Strengths & weaknesses

- ✅ **Condorcet-efficient** — elects the head-to-head winner; **no center squeeze**.
- ✅ Keeps the familiar round-by-round runoff "feel" of RCV.
- ❌ Still **not monotonic** in general, and still **not summable** (you need the full ballots to run the head-to-heads).
- ❌ Slightly more to explain than Hare ("why those two?"), which matters for adoption.

## Where it's used

Mostly a **reform proposal** rather than current law — introduced by Rob LeGrand (2006) as "BTR-STV," and a frequent suggestion for making RCV-IRV Condorcet-compliant with minimal change to how it already works. Compare with the no-elimination Condorcet method, **[Ranked Robin (RCV-RR)](../../RCV_Ranked_Robin/ranked_robin.md)**.
