# "Exhausted Ballots" — What FairVote's Word Actually Hides
### Voting 301 · advanced · an RCV-IRV misconceptions reference

The deepest RCV-IRV terminology trap, so this file goes slow. If you remember one thing:

> **"Exhausted ballot" is ONE word stretched over several very different things.** That vagueness is the whole problem: it lets proponents wave the issue away by pointing at the harmless cases, while the *method-caused* cases — where a voter ranked everyone correctly and still had rankings thrown out — hide under the same label.

This is a **clarity** document, not a hit piece. We state FairVote's own definition and steelman their defense, then show the distinctions they leave out. Throughout, the contrast is STAR: **STAR counts every ballot in both rounds, so nothing is ever "exhausted."**

## 1. Precision first: exhaustion is an **IRV** thing, not a ranked-ballot thing

The single most useful correction: ballot exhaustion is a property of **IRV's eliminate-and-transfer count**, *not* of ranked ballots in general. The *same* ranked ballot, counted by **Ranked Robin** or any Condorcet method, reads **every** ranking — nothing exhausts. Most voters actually assume that's how their ranked ballot is counted; almost everywhere it isn't (it's IRV).

So the precise sentence is *"**RCV-IRV** has exhausted ballots,"* never *"RCV has exhausted ballots."* (See `00_start_here/TIPS_terminology.md`.) <!-- terminology-ok: quotes the imprecise phrasing to correct it -->

## 2. What "exhausted" actually conflates — the taxonomy

FairVote's own definition (their FAQ) gives three reasons a ballot goes "inactive / exhausted": (1) the voter didn't rank all candidates and all their ranked candidates got eliminated — *"voluntary abstention,"* their most common case; (2) an administrator **ranking limit** (e.g. cap of 3) eliminated all their ranked candidates — *"involuntary";* (3) ballot **error**, e.g. the same rank twice (rare). Accurate as far as it goes — but it blurs two very different buckets:

**Bucket A — "this can happen under Choose-One too" (mostly voter-side):**
- **Overvotes** — marking two candidates at one rank; spoils that rank.
- **Undervotes / skipped ranks** — note the trap: in Choose-One an *undervote* is a blank, uncounted ballot; in RCV-IRV an "undervote" is a *single skipped ranking*, and the ballot may still count. Same word, different thing.
- **Voluntary truncation / bullet voting** — the voter chose to rank only one or a few.

These are roughly comparable to a Choose-One voter who skips the race or backs a sure loser. Concede them; they're not the interesting part.

**Bucket B — "purely a product of the elimination count" (the ones glossed over):**
- **Involuntary truncation (ranking limits).** You'd have ranked more, but the ballot only allowed 3–5; all of them got eliminated. You did nothing wrong.
- **Exhausted-untransferable.** Your *lower* choices were eliminated *before* your favorite, so when your favorite finally loses, the vote has nowhere left to go.
- **Nonexhausted-untransferred.** Your top *remaining* choice reaches the final round and **loses** — your lower preferences are simply never read, because counting stopped. (This one isn't even *labeled* "exhausted," yet the rankings still don't count — which is exactly why the famous promise is false.)

Bucket B is the part that's *purely* an artifact of IRV's round-by-round elimination. A voter who ranked everyone, correctly and completely, can still have real preferences discarded. *(On the Exhausted Ballots deck these are the **yellow** box = ranking-limit truncation, **red** box = exhausted-untransferable, and **blue** box = nonexhausted-untransferred.)* The vetted taxonomy (note that nonexhausted-untransferred is *active-but-under-counted*, not literally "inactive"):

## 3. The false claim that the vague word protects

The line you'll hear: **"If your first choice is eliminated, your next choice will be counted."** It is false, and the fuzziness of "exhausted" is what lets it pass:

- If your favorite makes the **final two and loses**, your other rankings are *never read* — that's the nonexhausted-untransferred case.
- Your next choice may **already be eliminated** by the time your vote is free to move, so it transfers to nobody.
- Even the softer phrasing — *"next choice"* instead of *"second choice"* — is only *less wrong*, not right. And note the smuggled conflation of **"first choice"** with **"first round."**

The honest version is: *which* of your rankings get counted depends on the **order of elimination** — something you can't see or control.

### A concrete example — *which* ranks IRV threw away

27 voters, three candidates on a spectrum ([`center_squeeze_star.yaml`](../../method_comparisons/center_squeeze/center_squeeze_star.yaml)):

| Voters | Their ballot (full ranking) | What IRV did with it | Rank IRV **never read** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | Left > Center > Right | Left led every round and **won** | **Center (2nd)**, Right (3rd) |
| 9  | Right > Center > Left | Right reached the final two, then **lost** | **Center (2nd)**, Left (3rd) |
| 6  | Center > Left > Right | Center eliminated in round 1; ballot transferred to Left | Right (3rd) |

IRV's rounds: first choices are Left 12, Right 9, **Center 6** — so Center is eliminated first; its 6 ballots move to Left, and **Left wins 18–9.** Now look at the last column: **21 of 27 voters ranked Center *second*, and IRV read none of those rankings.** Left's and Right's voters never transferred (their first choice survived round 1), so their Center-2nd preference was simply never consulted.

What those ignored ranks would have said: **Center beats Left head-to-head 15–12** and **beats Right 18–9** — Center is the **Condorcet (pairwise) winner**, the candidate a majority prefers over *each* opponent. IRV eliminated Center anyway, for having the fewest *first* choices, without ever making those head-to-head comparisons.

> **This is the misconception in one line.** The public pictures RCV as *pairwise* — "my second choice gets compared head-to-head." That's a **Condorcet** count (**Ranked Robin**), **not IRV.** IRV only ever looks at each ballot's *top surviving* mark, so a second choice is read **only if** your current candidate is eliminated. Here, that meant 21 voters' decisive Center ranking never counted at all. <!-- terminology-ok: describes the public misconception, then corrects it -->

STAR (and Ranked Robin) read every ballot: STAR elects **Center**, and the engine prints `[Condorcet Winner] = Center`. Run both to see it:

```
python3 06_Other/RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_tabulation_engine/rcv_irv_tabulation.py    01_Single_winner/center_squeeze_star.yaml   # Left wins; Center out in round 1
python3 STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/starvote_larry_hastings.py 01_Single_winner/center_squeeze_star.yaml   # Center wins; Condorcet = Center
```

---

## 4. The "manufactured majority" — majority of *remaining* ballots

Because exhausted ballots leave the count, IRV's "50% + 1" is a majority of the ballots **still active**, not of all ballots cast. **Alaska 2022 (US House special):** when Begich was eliminated, **11,243 ballots exhausted**; Peltola's 91,266 votes were **51.5% of the *remaining* ballots but only 48.4% of all Round-1 ballots** — a "majority winner" on a shrinking denominator.

It's systematic, not a one-off. A peer-reviewed study (Burnett & Kogan, *Electoral Studies*, 2015) of 600,000+ ballots across four California IRV elections found final-round exhaustion from **~9.6% to 27.1%** (Oakland's 2014 mayoral race ~24%) — and in **all four, the winner won with less than a majority of all ballots cast.**

## 5. The honest steelman — and the precise response

**FairVote's defense:** *"In Choose-One, every vote not for the winner is 'wasted' too — so what's new?"* Fair, for **Bucket A**: a first-round bullet vote or a spoiled ballot really is comparable to Choose-One. Concede that cleanly.

**The response:** the comparison breaks on **Bucket B**. Those losses happen in **later** rounds, to voters who ranked **fully and correctly** — information they *did* express is discarded purely because of the elimination order. Choose-One has no equivalent, because Choose-One never asked for more than one mark. *That* asymmetry — not the harmless first-round cases — is the real criticism, and it's the one the overloaded word "exhausted" is so good at hiding.

---

## 6. The STAR contrast (the payoff)

This is why STAR sidesteps the entire mess: **STAR counts every ballot in both rounds.** Nothing is eliminated, so nothing exhausts. And a STAR **"no-preference"** ballot (equal scores on the two finalists) is the *opposite* of an exhausted one: it's **present data** — a voter who *declared a tie* — that **still counted in the scoring round** to help pick the finalists. It isn't missing information thrown away; it's information that says "I'm equally happy with either."

That distinction — *declared tie* (STAR) vs *lost voice* (IRV exhaustion) — is the hinge, and it's developed in full in the companion episode.

> [REPO] `00_start_here/STAR_Voting/are_equal_score_votes_discounted.md` — the STAR-side of this same contrast (Segment B: "declared tie vs lost voice"). [DEMO] `01_Single_winner/equal_support_runoff_demo.yaml` — no-preference ballots that *picked the finalists*, then stayed neutral in the runoff.

---

## 7. The conversation (Larry ↔ Adam) — recording cut

**Larry:** RCV folks say "your vote always counts — if your first choice loses, your next choice is counted." That sounds reassuring. True?

**Adam:** It's the most oversold sentence in the whole debate. It's only true if your favorite is eliminated *early*. If your favorite instead makes the final two and loses, none of your other rankings are ever read — the count already stopped. And sometimes your second choice is gone before your vote can even move. So "your next choice will be counted" is, for a lot of voters, just false.

**Larry:** But they call those ballots "exhausted," like the voter ran out of choices.

**Adam:** That's the sleight of hand. "Exhausted" is one word covering five different situations — overvotes, skipped ranks, bullet votes, ranking limits, and the elimination-order cases. Some are the voter's doing and totally fair. But others happen to people who ranked everyone correctly, purely because of the order candidates dropped out. Lumping all five under one fuzzy word lets you point at the harmless cases and pretend the others don't exist.

**Larry:** And STAR?

**Adam:** STAR never eliminates anyone, so nothing exhausts — every ballot is read in both rounds. The closest thing, an equal-score "no-preference" ballot, is a voter telling us they like both finalists the same. That's *information*, and it still counted to pick the finalists. It's a declared tie, not a lost voice.

---

## 8. How to deploy it

- **Don't open with this.** It's 301, and it requires the audience already grasp IRV's round-by-round elimination. With a general audience, the one-liner ("declared tie, not lost voice") is enough.
- **Lead by splitting the word.** Half the disagreement evaporates the moment you separate Bucket A (fair) from Bucket B (method-caused).
- **Concede Bucket A immediately** — the candor is what earns the room for Bucket B.
- **End on STAR, not on RCV's flaws:** "counts every ballot, in both rounds."

## Where this fits in the overall teaching

- **Level:** Voting 301 — pairs with `favorite_betrayal_voting_301.md` (the *other* IRV-internals deep dive) and `are_equal_score_votes_discounted.md` (the STAR no-preference side of this exact contrast).
- **Terminology:** strictly **RCV-IRV / IRV** here — exhaustion is IRV-specific; Ranked Robin and the Condorcet methods read every ranking.
