# Center Squeeze

**One line:** a broadly-liked moderate is eliminated *early* because few voters rank/score them **first**, so a more polarizing candidate the majority actually opposed goes on to win. It's an **[RCV-IRV (Hare)](RCV-IRV-Hare.md)** failure — a property of the *eliminate-the-fewest-first-choices* rule specifically, not of ranked ballots in general (and not of every instant-runoff variant); STAR avoids it.

## Why it happens — and how you know it's *Hare*

IRV only ever looks at each ballot's **top remaining** choice, and each round it **eliminates the candidate with the fewest first choices** — *that* elimination rule is what "**Hare**" names. A moderate who is almost everyone's strong **second** choice — but few people's first — has the fewest first-place votes, so the Hare rule drops them before their broad support is ever counted. The two wings survive; the consensus candidate doesn't.

**So when a page says "center squeeze," assume Hare.** It's a property of the fewest-first-choices elimination rule — the one US "RCV" uses — and it is **not** a property of ranked ballots in general, nor even of every instant-runoff variant:

- **[Ranked Robin](../RCV_Ranked_Robin/ranked_robin.md)** (a Condorcet count of the *same* ballot) doesn't eliminate at all, so it has **no** center squeeze.
- The **Condorcet-safe IRV variants** — **BTR-IRV, Baldwin, Nanson** — keep the instant-runoff *shape* but stop eliminating on first-choices alone, so a Condorcet winner can never be squeezed out. Fittingly, **Nanson** — quoted at the bottom of this page warning about exactly this flaw in **1882** — designed one of those fixes.

So the precise statement isn't "RCV has center squeeze," or even "IRV" — it's <!-- terminology-ok: quotes the imprecise claim --> **RCV-IRV (Hare)**. For the full family, see [Which RCV-IRV? — Hare and the other variants](RCV_IRV_variants.md) and [the terminology tips](../TIPS_terminology.md).

## Minimal test case — run it

The smallest clean squeeze, as a matched pair (27 voters, Left / Center / Right):

→ [`center_squeeze_irv.yaml`](../../method_comparisons/center_squeeze/center_squeeze_irv.yaml) · [`center_squeeze_star.yaml`](../../method_comparisons/center_squeeze/center_squeeze_star.yaml)

Center is the **Condorcet winner** (beats Left 15–12, Right 18–9) but has the **fewest first-choices (6)**. The STAR file's output shows all four methods on the same ballots:

```
Choose-One (Plurality) = Left     RCV-IRV = Left     Approval = Left
STAR = Center   ( = Condorcet winner — also what Ranked Robin would elect )
```

IRV eliminates Center in round 1; STAR advances Center on strength of support and wins the runoff. (Verified on the engine.) A richer themed version is the Star Wars vote-split demo, [`04_star_wars_vote_split.yaml`](../../method_comparisons/split_voting/_main/04_star_wars_vote_split.yaml).

## A visual example — the voteline 1-D spectrum

The squeeze is easiest to *see* on a left–right spectrum. In the classic **voteline** demo ([zesty.ca/voting/voteline](http://zesty.ca/voting/voteline/); walkthrough in this video, [youtu.be/7btAd1HYvjU?t=1782](https://youtu.be/7btAd1HYvjU?t=1782)), three candidates sit on a line — **Red** (left), **Green** (center), **Yellow** (right) — and voters are spread across it. Slide the voters around and you can watch IRV *cross a threshold* into the squeeze. Here is the configuration where it bites:

```
red > green > yellow : 33.2%      green > yellow > red : 17.5%
green > red > yellow : 13.8%      yellow > green > red : 35.3%
```

**First choices:** Yellow 35.3%, Red 33.2%, **Green 31.3% (fewest).** So:

- **RCV-IRV** eliminates **Green** first (the center!), its ballots split to the two wings, and **Yellow wins 52.9%.**
- But **Green is the Condorcet winner** — it beats Red (66.6 vs 33.2) *and* Yellow (64.5 vs 35.3) head-to-head. IRV threw out the one candidate a majority preferred over each rival.
- **STAR** advances Green on its scores (lots of 3s from both wings + 5s from the center) and wins the runoff **65–35**.

Run it: [`center_squeeze_voteline_1d.yaml`](../../method_comparisons/center_squeeze/center_squeeze_voteline_1d.yaml) (scores are a simple 1-D spatial model: own side 5, the adjacent center 3, the far side 0–1; weights are the percentages ×10). The engine's own divergence block:

```
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = Green
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Yellow   (differs from STAR)
  RCV-IRV                = Yellow   (differs from STAR)

Scoring Round      Green 3620 (1st) · Yellow 2428 (2nd) · Red 2249
Automatic Runoff   Green 645 (65%) vs Yellow 353 (35%)   → Green wins
```

| Method | Winner |
|---|---|
| Plurality | Yellow |
| **RCV-IRV / Hare** | **Yellow** ❌ — squeezes out the center |
| Approval · Borda · Condorcet · Ranked Robin | Green |
| **STAR** | **Green** ✅ (= the Condorcet winner) |

**The threshold, made concrete.** This isn't randomness — it's structural. With the voters more *centered*, Green has enough first-choices to survive elimination and RCV-IRV happens to elect Green too. Shift the electorate so the wings (Red, Yellow) each out-poll the center on *first* choices, and Green is eliminated first — the squeeze appears. STAR and the Condorcet methods elect Green on **both** sides of that line, because they read the whole ballot, not just the top choice. *(This is also why "RCV ≠ Random" — IRV fails here predictably, every time the geometry repeats.)*

## Vote splitting vs center squeeze

They look alike but aren't. **Vote splitting** is *similar* candidates sharing one pool of supporters. **Center squeeze** is a *distinct* moderate squeezed by two poles whose voters are different — the moderate can beat each pole head-to-head and still be eliminated for too few first-choices. (Volić, *Making Democracy Count*, 2024.)

## "Core support" doesn't rescue IRV

IRV advocates excuse the squeeze by saying the moderate simply lacked **"core support"** (first-place votes). But the squeezed Condorcet winner can have *more* first-place votes than the eventual IRV winner and still be eliminated — so the "core support" defense doesn't hold. The worked case: **[the Ossipoff electorate (BV2158)](../../method_comparisons/paradoxes_and_whoops/bv2158_gr72hd_ossipoff_centrist_irv.md)** — candidate C has the **most** first-choices of anyone (100, vs. the field's 49–53) *and* beats every rival head-to-head, yet IRV eliminates C and elects D. First-place support was highest *and* pairwise dominance was total; the elimination order threw both away.

## Why it matters: polarization

Center squeeze is a depolarization argument, not just a fairness one. A simulation study of candidate incentives (**Ogren 2023**, *Candidate Incentive Distributions*, arXiv 2306.07147) finds IRV pushes candidates to court their **base** far more than opposing voters, while **STAR and Condorcet methods** reward appealing to opposing-side voters roughly *as much* as the base — and the gap grows with more candidates. Electing squeezed moderates is how a method lowers the temperature.

## Real elections

- **Burlington, VT 2009 (mayor).** Montroll was the Condorcet winner — preferred over Wright 56–44 and over Kiss 54–46 — but had too few first-choices, was eliminated, and **Kiss won**. IRV was repealed there in 2010.
- **[Alaska 2022 (US House special)](RCV_IRV_alaska_2022.md).** Begich beat both Peltola and Palin head-to-head, but was eliminated first; **Peltola won.** (Worked through in [Favorite betrayal (301)](../STAR_Voting/favorite_betrayal_voting_301.md).)

## How STAR avoids it

STAR's scoring round advances the **two highest totals**, so a broadly-liked candidate (lots of 4s and 5s) reaches the runoff on *strength of support*, not just first-place counts — exactly the support a moderate has and IRV ignores. STAR is highly **Condorcet-efficient**: it usually elects the head-to-head winner.

**Watch it happen (simulation).** endolith's *elsim* has animated 2-D spatial simulations of the worst-case **"core collapse"** center squeeze. As its write-up puts it:

> Under IRV, vote-splitting causes the most-representative candidate to be eliminated first, then the second-best eliminated second, and so on until only the worst two are left in the final round and the second-worst wins… Under TVR [Total Vote Runoff], on the other hand, all voter preferences are included, so the least-representative candidates are eliminated first, transferring their ballots inwards such that support converges to the consensus candidate in the middle of the electorate (who… is the Condorcet winner).

**A 140-year-old warning.** This isn't new — E. J. Nanson described it in **1882**, calling IRV "Ware's method":

> Then on the single vote method [plurality] R may win; on Ware's method A, B, C, D, … P, may be excluded one after another on the successive scrutinies, and at the final scrutiny the contest will be between Q and R, and Q, of course, wins… Thus the single vote method may return the worst of all the candidates; and although **Ware's method cannot return the worst, it may return the next worst.** — Nanson, *Methods of Election* (1882)
