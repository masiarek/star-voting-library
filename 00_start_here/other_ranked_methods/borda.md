# Borda Count — Manufacturing Scores from Ranks

*If a **score** ballot can be reduced to a **ranking** (drop the intensity), can you go the other way — turn a ranking back into scores? You can. The one principled way to do it is the **Borda count**, and the act of doing it is exactly **inventing** the intensity the voter never gave.*

## What Borda does

Assign points by a candidate's **position** in the ranking: with N candidates, 1st place = N−1 points, 2nd = N−2, …, last = 0. Then add the points across all ballots; highest total wins. That's the whole method — **positional scoring**.

Conveniently, the even-spaced points for a 6-candidate ballot land on **0–5**, so a Borda'd ranking *looks* exactly like a STAR ballot:

```
ranked:   E > A > B > F > D > C
Borda  →  E=5  A=4  B=3  F=2  D=1  C=0
```

Tied ranks get the **average** of the positions they span (a "midrank"). So `E > A=B=F > D > C` → E=5, then A,B,F share (4+3+2)/3 = **3** each, D=1, C=0.

## The catch: Borda *assumes equal gaps*

Those manufactured scores are **scores under an assumption** — never the voter's scores. A ranking carries *order only*; it is silent on *how much* you prefer one rank over the next. Borda fills that silence by assuming every gap is the same size. But the voter might have felt a **cliff**, not a **ramp**:

```
ranked:        E   >  A  >  B  >  F  >  D  >  C
the voter felt:  E ≈ A ≈ B  (all great)   ≫   F, D, C  (all bad)
real scores:     5,  5,  5,                    1,  0,  0
Borda's guess:   5,  4,  3,                    2,  1,  0   ← flattens the cliff into a ramp
```

Borda has no way to know the difference — *the intensity was never on the ballot*. So any scores it produces are an artifact of the **spacing rule**, not the electorate.

## Different spacings → different "scores"

There isn't one "right" way to invent intensity; each spacing tells a different story:

| Spacing | Points (top → bottom) | Assumes… |
|---------|------------------------|----------|
| **Borda (even)** | 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 | every gap is equal |
| **Dowdall** | 1, ½, ⅓, ¼, … | the *top* ranks matter far more |
| **Convex / concave** | your choice | a steeper or flatter intensity curve |

All are defensible conventions; none is *the* answer. (This is also why Borda is strategy-prone — burying a rival or running clones shifts everyone's positional points.)

## The fidelity ladder — how much each conversion *invents*

This is the key idea. Converting between scores and ranks is never free; what matters is **how much you fabricate**:

| Conversion | Used by | Drops | **Invents** |
|------------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **score → weak rank** | **Ranked Robin** | intensity | **nothing** — ties stay ties (`A=B`) |
| **score → strict rank** | **RCV-IRV** | intensity | a tie-break order (`A=B` forced to `A>B`) |
| **rank → score** | **Borda** | — | the **whole intensity** (the spacing) |

Read top to bottom and the fabrication grows. **Ranked Robin's reduction is the honest one** — precisely because weak ranks let it keep the ties the voter expressed, so it invents nothing. IRV can't represent a tie, so it has to make one up (that's its fragility). Borda sits at the far end: it conjures the entire intensity dimension out of pure order.

That asymmetry is why **STAR → ranks works but ranks → STAR doesn't recover anything**: a score ballot *contains* its ranking, but a ranking never contained scores.

## Is Borda "bad," then?

No — Borda is a real, century-old, sometimes-used method (it sits in the **Positional** branch of the [methods family tree](../RCV_IRV/RCV_methods_family_tree.mermaid)). It's even the engine inside the Condorcet-safe IRV variants [Baldwin and Nanson](../RCV_IRV/RCV-IRV-Baldwin-Nanson.md), which eliminate by Borda score. The honest rule is just about **labeling**:

> **Manufacturing scores from ranks is fine — call them "Borda / positional points," never "the voter's scores."** The only real error is printing invented numbers next to the word *scores* as if the voter had typed them.

## In this repo

- The engine can *optionally* show this on a ranked Ranked Robin ballot — set `options: { show_borda: true }` to annotate each ballot with its positional points, clearly labeled as Borda (not scores, and not what RR actually counts — RR uses pairwise).
- Borda is **not Condorcet**; its Condorcet-fixing cousins are [Baldwin & Nanson](../RCV_IRV/RCV-IRV-Baldwin-Nanson.md).
