# Approval Voting — Honest Limits

**One line:** Approval is the *simplest* equal-vote method — mark everyone you approve, most
approvals wins — and that simplicity is both its strength and its weakness. It throws away
preference **strength and order**, and it hands the voter one hard, unavoidable decision:
**where to draw the approval line.** STAR was designed largely to fix exactly this gap.

## 1. No preference strength or order

An Approval ballot is binary per candidate: approve or not. You cannot say "I **love** A but
merely **tolerate** B" — both get the same checkmark. All intensity *and* all ranking
information is discarded. For voters who feel strongly about ordering their approved
candidates, that expressiveness is simply gone.

## 2. The approval-threshold dilemma (the central critique)

Because the ballot is binary, the entire strategic burden collapses onto **one question:
where do I draw my approval line?** Two voters with *identical* honest opinions can rationally
approve different sets — one bullet-votes their favorite, the other approves their top three —
and those choices can swing the result. There is no honest, obvious threshold; the method
makes the voter do the strategic work that STAR's 0–5 scale and runoff absorb.

## 3. Strong incentive to bullet-vote (or over-approve)

Two opposite pressures pull on every ballot: approve **only** your favorite (so you don't
help a rival you also approve), or approve **widely** (to block a worse candidate). Both are
rational depending on the polls, so Approval outcomes can hinge on how strategically the
electorate reads the race rather than on sincere opinion.

## 4. Can miss a majority favorite (lowest-common-denominator)

A broadly **inoffensive** candidate approved by many can beat a candidate who is the
*first choice of a majority* but polarizing. Sometimes that broad-consensus winner is the
right call — but Approval can't distinguish "everyone's warm second choice" from "the
majority's passionate first choice," because it never sees the difference.

## 5. Fails Later-No-Harm

Approving a second choice can help that candidate beat your favorite. (STAR and Ranked Robin
share this tradeoff; RCV-IRV is the one that keeps Later-No-Harm.)

## Keep it in perspective

Approval's limits are the flip side of real strengths: it passes the **Equal Vote**, is
trivially easy to explain and to tabulate (add the approvals; precinct-summable), and it
already ends *forced* vote-splitting. STAR keeps Approval's equal-vote guarantee while adding
the missing **strength + order** (a 0–5 score) and a **majority runoff** to answer the
threshold dilemma — which is precisely the gap the Equal Vote Coalition set out to close when
STAR was designed. Every method trades something away (Gibbard); Approval trades expressiveness
for simplicity.
