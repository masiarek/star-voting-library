# RCV-IRV vs. STAR — A Side-by-Side

*A neutral overview routing to the detailed facet pages. The honest summary: each method has real, documented strengths the other lacks — this is about specific trade-offs, not one being good and the other bad.*

---

Both ask more of voters than Choose-One, and both usually beat plain plurality. They differ in **what the ballot captures** and **how it's counted**.

| | **RCV-IRV (Hare)** | **STAR** |
|---|---|---|
| Ballot | Rank candidates in order (no ties) | Score each 0–5 (ties allowed) |
| Captures | Order only | Order **+ strength** |
| Count | Eliminate fewest-first-choice, transfer, repeat | Sum scores → automatic runoff of top 2 |
| Equal preferences | ❌ Not allowed | ✅ Allowed |
| Precinct-summable | ❌ No (needs central count) | ✅ Yes |
| Exhausted ballots | ❌ Possible | ✅ Avoided (blank = 0) |
| Monotonic | ❌ No (more support can hurt) | ✅ Yes |
| Later-No-Harm | ✅ **Satisfies** | ❌ Fails |
| Majority criterion | ✅ **Satisfies** | ❌ Can fail |
| Center squeeze | ❌ Vulnerable | ✅ Resists |
| Track record at scale | ✅ Widely used (Maine, Alaska, many cities) | ⚠️ Limited adoption to date |

Read that table both ways. The rows where STAR wins (summability, monotonicity, no exhaustion, center-squeeze resistance) are real; so are the rows where **IRV** wins (Later-No-Harm, the majority criterion, and a far larger real-world track record). No method escapes Gibbard–Satterthwaite — each has scenarios where honesty is punished.

## Where each is genuinely stronger

**IRV's honest advantages.** It satisfies **Later-No-Harm** (ranking a backup can never hurt your favorite) and the **majority criterion** (a candidate who is the first choice of an outright majority always wins) — both of which STAR/Score can fail. It also has by far the **larger deployment record** in real public elections, which matters for legal precedent, vendor support, and voter familiarity.

**STAR's honest advantages.** It's **monotonic**, **precinct-summable**, doesn't **exhaust** ballots, lets voters express **strength** and **equal support**, and **resists center squeeze**. Its ballot is the familiar five-star format.

**Each one's price.** IRV's elimination mechanism produces [center squeeze](../RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_center_squeeze.md), [non-monotonicity](../RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_non_monotonicity.md), [exhausted ballots](../RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_exhausted_ballots.md), and [no precinct summability](../RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_lack_of_summability.md). STAR's price is failing **Later-No-Harm**, the **majority criterion**, and the **Participation criterion** (a no-show paradox — adding sincere ballots favoring a candidate can, in rare constructed cases, hurt them; this is the runoff's cost, and is *not* the same as monotonicity, which STAR does satisfy), plus an incentive toward **strategic min/max scoring**.

> **Note on Participation:** the no-show paradox is a real but *rare* failure, and IRV fails Participation too — so it isn't a STAR-vs-IRV differentiator, just an honest caveat that STAR isn't flawless. The runoff that causes it is the same step that guarantees STAR rejects a Condorcet loser. No method escapes Gibbard–Satterthwaite.
