# Topic: Ties & Tie-Breaking

**Topic hub — a cross-method view.** Real elections occasionally produce **exact ties** — two
candidates with the same score, the same pairwise record, or the same first-choice count.
Every method needs a defined, reproducible rule for resolving them; the rules (and how often
ties even arise) differ by method.

> **The one idea to take away:** *a tie-break should be **deterministic and disclosed**, not
> a coin toss after the fact.* This repo uses an official **lot-number** order
> (`lot_numbers:`) so any tie resolves the same way every run — auditable, not arbitrary.

## Where ties happen — and where each is treated

| Method | Where a tie can occur | How it's resolved | Full page |
|--------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **STAR** | scoring round (which two advance) **or** the automatic runoff | official tiebreak protocol, then lot order | [Tie-breaking in STAR](../../STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md) |
| **STAR (reporting)** | how a tie is *displayed* in the result | reported explicitly, not hidden | [reporting ties](../../STAR_reporting/reporting_ties.md) |
| **RCV-IRV (Hare)** | which candidate to eliminate when two are tied for last | by statute — lot / prior round | [Which RCV-IRV? § tie-breaks](../../RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_variants.md) |
| **Ranked Robin** | a pairwise tie, or a Condorcet **cycle** | total margin, then lot order | [cycle resolution](../../RCV_Ranked_Robin/cycle_resolution.md) |

Runnable tie cases (flat-score ballots engineered to tie) live in
[`Flat_scores_ties/`](../../../01_STAR/Flat_scores_ties) — useful for seeing exactly
when each round produces a tie and how the lot order settles it.

Glossary: [`lot numbers`](../../GLOSSARY.md).
