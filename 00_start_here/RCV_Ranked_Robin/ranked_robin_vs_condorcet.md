# Ranked Robin vs. "the Condorcet winner" — same animal, until there's a cycle

*A question that trips up almost everyone: aren't **Ranked Robin (RCV-RR)** and **Condorcet** the same thing? Almost — and the gap between them is the whole lesson.*

## The one-line answer

- A **Condorcet winner** is a candidate who beats **every** other candidate one-on-one. Sometimes **nobody** does (a *cycle*), so the Condorcet winner is **undefined — blank**.
- **Ranked Robin (RCV-RR / Copeland)** counts each candidate's head-to-head **wins** and elects whoever has the **most** (ties broken by total margin, then lot). It **always** produces a winner.

> **Ranked Robin = Condorcet + a built-in tiebreaker for cycles.** When a Condorcet winner exists, Ranked Robin elects exactly that candidate — *same animal.* When none exists, Condorcet is blank but Ranked Robin still names someone.

The cleanest way to see it is the **same three candidates, two different electorates.**

## Case 1 — a Condorcet winner exists → they agree

Five voters, candidates Ada / Ben / Cara ([`01_condorcet_winner.yaml`](../../05_Ranked_Robin/condorcet_vs_ranked_robin/01_condorcet_winner.yaml)):

```
3 × Ada > Ben > Cara
2 × Ben > Ada > Cara
```

Ada beats Ben (3–2) **and** beats Cara (5–0) — Ada beats everyone, so **Ada is the Condorcet winner**. Ranked Robin agrees, because Ada also has the most wins:

```
    #  Candidate  W–L–T  Copeland  Margin  Beats
    1  Ada        2–0–0         2      +6  Ben, Cara
    2  Ben        1–1–0         1      +4  Cara
    3  Cara       0–2–0         0     -10  —

Winner — Ranked Robin (RCV-RR): Ada
   beats every opponent head-to-head — the Condorcet winner.
```

**Ranked Robin = Condorcet = Ada.** No daylight between them.

## Case 2 — a cycle (rock-paper-scissors) → they part ways

Now seven voters, same three candidates ([`02_cycle_no_condorcet.yaml`](../../05_Ranked_Robin/condorcet_vs_ranked_robin/02_cycle_no_condorcet.yaml)):

```
3 × Ada > Ben > Cara
2 × Ben > Cara > Ada
2 × Cara > Ada > Ben
```

Now the head-to-heads chase each other in a circle — exactly like rock-paper-scissors:

- **Ada beats Ben** 5–2
- **Ben beats Cara** 5–2
- **Cara beats Ada** 4–3

**Nobody beats both others, so there is NO Condorcet winner** — the Condorcet answer is *blank*. But Ranked Robin still resolves it: everyone is 1–1, so it breaks the tie by **total margin**, and Ada (the strongest margins) wins:

```
    #  Candidate  W–L–T  Copeland  Margin  Beats
    1  Ada        1–1–0         1      +2  Ben
    2  Ben        1–1–0         1      +0  Cara
    3  Cara       1–1–0         1      -2  Ada

Winner — Ranked Robin (RCV-RR): Ada
   *** 3 candidates tie on wins — a Condorcet cycle. Resolved by total margin, then lot order.
```

This is the whole distinction in one election: **Condorcet = (blank), Ranked Robin = Ada.** (*How a cycle gets resolved is itself a design choice — Minimax, Ranked Pairs, and Schulze each break it differently. See [Cycle Resolution — why Minimax, Ranked Pairs, and Schulze exist](cycle_resolution.md).*)

## In the wild — record 0 from the random sweep

This isn't just a contrived 3-candidate trick. It's why the **Condorcet column was blank** in the random STAR sweep you ran (`tools_adam/random_star_divergence.py`). Take its very first divergent election — **record 0**, 6 candidates, 5 voters ([`03_real_record0_c6_b5.yaml`](../../05_Ranked_Robin/condorcet_vs_ranked_robin/03_real_record0_c6_b5.yaml)):

```
     A  B  C  D  E  F
#1:  3  3  0  2  4  3
#2:  3  2  3  2  4  1
#3:  4  1  2  1  0  4
#4:  2  4  5  4  1  2
#5:  0  5  0  5  2  3
```

A full 6×6 pairwise grid is hard to read, so look at the **win–loss record** instead — it tells the story at a glance:

```
    #  Candidate  W–L–T  Copeland  Margin  Beats
    1  B          3–1–1       3.5      +3  D, E, F
    2  A          2–1–2         3      +1  C, D
    3  C          2–3–0         2      -1  B, D
    4  D          2–3–0         2      -1  E, F
    5  E          2–3–0         2      -1  A, C
    6  F          2–2–1       2.5      -1  C, E

Winner — Ranked Robin (RCV-RR): B  (the most head-to-head wins, 3)
```

Read the top row: **B went 3–1–1 — not 5–0.** B beats D, E, F, *ties* A, and *loses* to C. So **no candidate beats all five rivals → there is no Condorcet winner → the column is blank.** Ranked Robin doesn't care: B has the **most wins (3)**, so **Ranked Robin elects B** — which also happens to be the STAR winner here.

That's the takeaway from the sweep: with only 5 ballots and 6 candidates, an undisputed head-to-head champion rarely exists, so **Condorcet is usually blank** — but **Ranked Robin always answers**, because "best record" always has a top.

## Same ballot, two different conversions (and why IRV is fragile)

Neither method reads *scores* — they read *ranks*, so a score ballot is converted first. But **Ranked Robin and RCV-IRV convert it differently**, and that gap is the whole reason IRV can be fragile. Take voter #1 from record 0 — `A3 B3 C0 D2 E4 F3`:

| Method | The ranking it reads | What it did with the tie |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Ranked Robin** (weak ranks) | `E > A=B=F > D > C` | kept the three-way tie at 3 as a real tie (`=`) |
| **RCV-IRV** (strict ranks)    | `E > A > B > F > D`  | **forced** `A=B=F` into `A > B > F` by priority, and **dropped C** (0 = unranked) |

Ranked Robin keeps equal scores **tied** — no head-to-head preference — which is exactly what its pairwise count uses. RCV-IRV **can't represent a tie**, so it *invents* a strict order: it breaks `A=B=F` by candidate priority into `A > B > F`, and treats C's 0 as *unranked* (so the ballot can later exhaust). That manufactured order is precisely why IRV is fragile — **reverse the priority and `A > B > F` becomes `F > B > A`**, which can change who gets eliminated and flip the winner. Ranked Robin never has to invent an order it wasn't given.

## So which should I say?

| You mean… | Say… |
|-----------|------|
| Is there an *undisputed* head-to-head champion? (may be **none**) | **Condorcet winner** |
| Who has the *best* head-to-head record? (**always** someone) | **Ranked Robin (RCV-RR)** |
| Both, when a Condorcet winner exists | they're the **same candidate** |
