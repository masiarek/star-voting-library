# Ranked Robin (RCV-RR) — Honest Limits

**One line:** Ranked Robin (RCV-RR) is a strong Condorcet method — it reads every rank, allows equal ranks, passes the Equal Vote, and has **no center squeeze** — but it inherits the two structural limits of ranked, Condorcet counting: it can hit a **cycle** with no clear winner, and it sees only **order, not strength**, so it can crown a bland compromise.

## 1. Condorcet cycles (no clear winner)

Sometimes there is **no Condorcet winner**: A beats B, B beats C, C beats A — a rock-paper-scissors "cycle." Then RCV-RR must fall back to a **resolution rule** (Copeland / margins), and any such rule is harder to explain and can feel arbitrary to a voter ("why did we break it *that* way?"). **How much it matters:** cycles are rare with real electorates, but they are the honest soft spot of every Condorcet method. See [cycle resolution](cycle_resolution.md).

## 2. No preference strength — the "milquetoast" winner

A ranked ballot captures *order only*, not *how much*. RCV-RR elects the candidate who wins the most head-to-head matchups — which can be a **broadly-acceptable compromise everyone ranks second and nobody is excited about**, over a candidate a majority passionately prefers. That's sometimes the right, consensus-seeking answer; but the method literally cannot see intensity, so it can't tell "warm second choice" from "grudging tolerance." (This is the mirror image of STAR's design, which *does* read strength via the 0–5 score.)

## 3. Fails Later-No-Harm; open to burial

Like STAR and Approval, RCV-RR fails Later-No-Harm — ranking a later choice can help them. More specifically it is open to **burial**: insincerely ranking a strong rival *last* can flip a pairwise matchup in your favorite's favor. Honest ranking is usually best, but the incentive exists (Gibbard again: no method is strategy-proof).

## 4. The count is harder to explain

"Add the stars" (STAR/Score) or "most approvals" (Approval) is a one-sentence tally. A **pairwise matrix** — every candidate against every other — plus cycle-handling is more to show a general audience, even though it's fully **summable and auditable**. Simplicity of *explanation* is a real adoption cost.

## 5. Clone independence — teaming (a narrow, tiebreak-specific failure)

RR **passes** vote-splitting (crowding) clone independence — because it counts head-to-head wins, cloning a candidate can't make that candidate lose. But it can fail **teaming** (running clones of *yourself*) in the one situation where there's **no Condorcet winner** and the winner turns on a **margin** tiebreak: a faction can field clones to reshape the margins and crowd a rival out of the top tier. Worth knowing, easy to overstate — and note it's implementation-dependent: an engine that breaks a 2-way tie by head-to-head (BetterVoting) resists the same attack that a margin tiebreak (LH / the Equal Vote protocol) succumbs to. Worked example: [Clone independence — crowding, teaming, and the tiebreak](rr_clone_independence.md).

## Keep it in perspective

RCV-RR's strengths are exactly why it's worth taking seriously: it passes the **Equal Vote**, reads **every** rank (nothing exhausts), allows equal ranks, and avoids RCV-IRV's center squeeze and non-monotonicity. Its limits — cycles and blindness to intensity — are the genuine cost of a ranked, consensus-first count. Every method trades something away (Arrow, Gibbard); the fair question is which tradeoffs you want, laid out for all four methods on the companion pages above.
