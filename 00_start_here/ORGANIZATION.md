# Organizing the YAML files (conventions)

Where things live, what goes in the YAML vs a Markdown file, and how to get a
clean demo without losing your documentation.

## The core principle: storage ≠ display

Most of the second-guessing ("if I document the scenario in the YAML it clutters
my recording") comes from treating *where the text lives* and *what shows on
screen* as the same decision. They aren't.

- **Keep the scenario text in the YAML** — one source of truth, travels with the
  ballots, can't drift out of sync.
- **Control what prints with an option** — `show_description: false` hides the
  long description on screen for a clean demo, *without removing it from the
  file*. The saved `_tabulated` file always keeps the full text.

So: store rich, display clean. You never have to choose.

## What goes where

| Content | Lives in | Prints on screen? |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| `election_title` | YAML | yes (one-line banner) |
| `scenario_description` — short, audience-facing "what" | YAML | yes, unless `show_description: false` |
| `video_script` — presenter notes, cues, "how to present" | YAML | **no** (never echoed) |
| Cross-file teaching (lessons, sequences, comparisons, "why") | **Markdown** (`00_start_here/`, folder READMEs) | n/a |

Rule of thumb: **per-file context → in the YAML; cross-file teaching → Markdown.**
If a paragraph is about *this one election*, it belongs in the file. If it's
about how several examples fit together, it belongs in an `.md`.

## Generated pages: a browsable `.md` per YAML — but never hand-written

Every election YAML also gets a **generated** Markdown page in
`<folder>/<folder>_pages/<stem>.md` (`STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`): title,
method (linked to its concept docs), the file's own scenario description, the
ballots with a how-to-read line, the engine's full report (from the
`_tabulated` mirror), and auto cross-references (folder README, topic hubs,
divergence-ledger entry, siblings, glossary, index).
`tests/test_yaml_pages_current.py` fails the suite if a page drifts from its
sources — so the pages are always right, precisely because nobody edits them.
The educational *prose* on a page comes from the YAML's own
`scenario_description`; improve the YAML, regenerate, and the page follows.

## Don't: a separate HAND-WRITTEN `.md` per YAML, or a folder per scenario

Tempting, but it creates exactly the sync problem you already dislike with the
Google Docs:

- **Per-YAML `.md`** doubles maintenance and drifts out of sync. The YAML already
  has two slots — `scenario_description` (printable) and `video_script` (notes) —
  which cover everything a single file needs.
- **A folder per scenario** (`yaml` + `md` + `_tabulated` together) fragments
  navigation: you can no longer skim a folder of examples, and the lesson order
  gets buried. Heavy for no benefit.

## Recommended folder structure (keep what you have)

Group by **teaching role**, not by file type:

Prominence follows the library's mission: the **equal-vote (EVC) methods get
the numbered, front-rank folders**; other methods appear mainly as contrast
material.

```
00_start_here/        lessons, glossary, curriculum, tips, conventions (Markdown)
01_STAR/              single-winner STAR — the headline method
  _main/              loose files that belong to no themed set
  _main/_main_tabulated/          their generated _tabulated.txt mirrors
  runoff_overturns_leader/ …      themed sets: YAMLs + README (+ img/), each
                                  with its mirrors nested inside
02_STAR_Bloc/         Bloc STAR (multi-winner, majoritarian)
03_STAR_PR/           proportional STAR (sss / allocated / rrv)
04_Approval/          Approval Voting
05_Ranked_Robin/      Ranked Robin (RCV-RR / Copeland)
method_comparisons/   SAME ballots, DIFFERENT methods — black_curtain,
                      center_squeeze, monotonicity, split_voting, summability,
                      paradoxes_and_whoops, BV_Library (matched sets stay together)
06_Other/        standalone non-EVC reference cases (RCV-IRV, STV…)
00_start_here/…          Larry↔Adam conversation scripts now live beside their topics
                      (STAR_Voting/, RCV_IRV/, 00_start_here/), indexed in conversation_scripts.md
STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/   the engine + tools
06_Other/RCV_IRV/RCV_IRV_tabulation_engine/       the RCV-IRV engine
```

- **`_tabulated` output nests INSIDE the source file's own folder** as
  `<folder>/<folder>_tabulated/` (the engine computes this:
  `tabulated_output_path`). Loose files live in a `_main/` subfolder so their
  mirrors nest the same way. Generated, regenerable, separate from source, but
  right next to the YAML it came from. (Committed by choice; they could be
  gitignored instead.)
- **Markdown teaching docs cluster in `00_start_here/`** and in each folder's
  `README.md`, so the prose has a home that isn't tangled with the data.

## The clean-demo / recording recipe

For a file you'll show on camera:

```yaml
options:
  show_description: false   # hide the long write-up
  show_matrix: false
  show_condorcet: false
  show_score_counts: false
  brief: true
  show_irv: false
```

That leaves just the title banner, the ballots, and the tabulation. The full
context is still in the file (and in its `_tabulated` copy) for anyone studying
it later. Flip the flags back to `true` for a workshop or self-study.

> Tip: keep `scenario_description` to 1–3 short paragraphs (the audience-facing
> "what"), and put longer staging notes in `video_script` — it never prints, so
> it can be as detailed as you like without ever cluttering a demo.
