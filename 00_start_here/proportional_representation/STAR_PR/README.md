# STAR-PR — proportional STAR, and its methods

**One line:** STAR-PR fills **several seats proportionally** using ordinary STAR **score ballots** (0–5). After each seat is awarded, the ballots that helped win it are **reweighted** (their remaining influence is reduced), so the next seat reflects the voters who haven't been represented yet. Same scored ballot as single-winner STAR — different counting, run as many times as there are seats.

## The core idea: quota + reweighting

A proportional method shares the seats among coalitions in proportion to their support, instead of letting the largest group take everything. Two ingredients:

1. **A quota** — the share of support that earns one seat. With *k* seats, the **Droop quota** is `votes / (k + 1)`, rounded up (for 3 seats, just over 25%).
2. **Reweighting** — once a candidate is seated, the ballots that scored them highly have "spent" some of their weight, so they count for less when the next seat is decided. That is what stops a 58% majority from sweeping all the seats.

This is the whole difference from **Bloc STAR**, which just elects the top *N* score-leaders with no reweighting — and is therefore *majoritarian*, not proportional (see the contrast below).

## The three STAR-PR methods

All three are proportional and use the same score ballots; they differ only in *how* a ballot's weight is spent after each seat. The LH engine runs each via `voting_method:` plus `num_winners: k`.

| Method | `voting_method` | How it reweights, in a line |
|---|---|---|
| **Allocated Score** | `allocated` | Seat the top scorer, then fully **spend a quota's worth** of the ballots that supported them most (those ballots are "used up"); repeat. This is the Equal Vote Coalition's recommended "STAR-PR." |
| **Sequentially Spent Score** (SSS) | `sss` | Like Allocated Score, but each supporting ballot **spends score proportionally** toward the quota rather than being fully exhausted — a smoother allocation. |
| **Reweighted Range Voting** (RRV) | `rrv` | Don't spend ballots; instead **divide each ballot's weight** by a growing factor based on how much score it has already given to winners (a D'Hondt/Jefferson-style divisor). |

In practice, on a clean two-coalition electorate they tend to **agree on the slate** (see the worked example below); they can diverge on closer or more fragmented races.

## The majoritarian contrast: Bloc STAR

`voting_method: bloc` runs STAR's score-then-runoff *N* times with **no reweighting**, so the largest bloc can win **every** seat. It's useful when you *want* an at-large majority result, and it's the method to **avoid when you want proportionality**. Keep it in the comparison precisely to show what reweighting buys you.

## Run them

```
voting_method: allocated   # or: sss | rrv   (proportional)
num_winners: 3
```

Worked examples in [`03_STAR_PR/`](../../../03_STAR_PR):

- [`02a_c5_b63_proportional-allocated-score.yaml`](../../../03_STAR_PR/_main/02a_c5_b63_proportional-allocated-score.yaml) — Allocated Score
- [`02b_c5_b63_proportional-sss.yaml`](../../../03_STAR_PR/_main/02b_c5_b63_proportional-sss.yaml) — SSS
- [`02c_c5_b63_proportional-rrv.yaml`](../../../03_STAR_PR/_main/02c_c5_b63_proportional-rrv.yaml) — RRV
- [`03b_star_pr_3seats.yaml`](../../../03_STAR_PR/_main/03b_star_pr_3seats.yaml) — STAR-PR vs the STV file in the same race
- [`01_c4_b2_bloc-star-2-seats.yaml`](../../../02_STAR_Bloc/_main/01_c4_b2_bloc-star-2-seats.yaml) — Bloc STAR (majoritarian contrast)

The head-to-head with STV, on one shared electorate, is in [STV vs STAR-PR](../stv/proportional_stv_vs_star.md): STV and all three STAR-PR methods land on the same proportional slate; Bloc STAR doesn't.

## Why proportional representation? (pros & cons)

Proportional representation elects candidates *in proportion to their support*: if a faction is a fifth of the electorate and votes together, it earns roughly one of five seats. The goal is a "round table" where any faction with enough support has a seat — in direct contrast to Bloc STAR, which lets the majority take **every** seat. This mirrors the public-facing framing on [starvoting.org/star-pr](https://www.starvoting.org/star-pr), condensed for reference.

**Pros:**

- **Diversity of representation** — smaller factions win seats even without a majority, so more voters end up genuinely represented.
- **Coalition-building** — factions must band together to pass anything, which rewards negotiation over winner-take-all.
- **Breaks two-party lock-in** — minor parties can gain a foothold where they'd never win a single-winner seat.
- **Mitigates gerrymandering** — multi-member districts are far harder to draw for advantage (though solving districting directly is better where possible).

**Cons:**

- **Less accountability over a specific incumbent** — with *k* seats, it can take roughly `k/(k+1)` of voters opposing someone to unseat them; smaller districts (fewer seats each) raise that bar back up. STAR-PR's expressive ballot softens this by surfacing less-polarizing candidates.
- **More complex to tally and less transparent** than single-winner or Bloc — voters may not fully follow how winners are determined (STAR-PR is still simpler than STV, but it's not trivial).
- **Possible stagnation** — hard-line factions can refuse to coalition and block legislation as leverage.
- **Not batch-summable** — STAR-PR ballots can't be tallied precinct-by-precinct and summed; they must be **centrally tabulated and audited** per election. That makes it best suited to local elections, or to regional multi-member districts at larger scale.

**The case for STAR-PR specifically:** the same 0–5 ballot works for single-winner, Bloc, and proportional races, so voters learn one ballot. The expressive scores give the method more to work with — it can favor broadly-supported candidates over polarizing ones — while keeping the tally simpler than ranked proportional methods like STV. It's non-partisan by default, though it can back a party-list system if desired, and pairs well with small/local districts to preserve accountability.
