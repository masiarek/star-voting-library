# STV — 3 seats, 7 candidates (proportional RCV)

*Generated from [`03a_stv_3seats.yaml`](../03a_stv_3seats.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STV (proportional, ranked ballots)](../../../00_start_here/proportional_representation) · **3 seats** · **Expected winners:** Housing, Schools, SmallBiz

## Scenario

STV — the proportional method for RANKED ballots — fills 3 seats from a
100-voter, 7-candidate field: a 58-voter community-services wing and a
42-voter business wing. Proportionality gives the majority two seats
(Housing, Schools) and the minority one (SmallBiz), where Bloc voting would
hand the majority a 3-0 sweep. Score-ballot counterpart: 03_STAR_PR/
(same electorate logic under sss / allocated / rrv).

## Ballots

Each row is one voter's ranking, most-preferred first (`N:` prefix = N identical ballots).
