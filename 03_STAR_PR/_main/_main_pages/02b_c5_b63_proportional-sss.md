# Proportional STAR — Sequentially Spent Score

*Generated from [`02b_c5_b63_proportional-sss.yaml`](../02b_c5_b63_proportional-sss.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [Sequentially Spent Score (proportional STAR)](../../../00_start_here/proportional_representation) · **3 seats** · **Expected winners:** Alice, Ben, Dan

## Scenario

Same majority/minority ballots as the Allocated Score example, tabulated with
Sequentially Spent Score (SSS), a modern proportional-score method. The
minority bloc again earns a seat that Bloc STAR would deny.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Alice,Ben,Cara,Dan,Eve
18: 5, 4, 3, 0, 0
12: 4, 5, 3, 0, 0
 9: 3, 4, 5, 0, 0
15: 0, 0, 0, 5, 4
 9: 0, 0, 0, 4, 5
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = Ben
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Alice   (differs from STAR)
  Approval               = Alice   (differs from STAR)
