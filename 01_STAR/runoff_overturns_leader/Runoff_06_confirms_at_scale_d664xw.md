# Runoff 06 — the runoff confirms the leader at scale (control)

**Level 101 · the closing control.** After four reversals, the reassurance: here the Scoring-Round leader **Wren** is *also* the candidate most voters prefer, so the Automatic Runoff **confirms** the leader, 4–1. *How much* and *how many* point at the same candidate — no reversal. (Wren is the Condorcet winner.)

This is the bookend to [Runoff 01](Runoff_01_confirms_leader_r2pvc9.md): most of the time the runoff just agrees with the score round. The reversals (02–05) are the exception — the safeguard catching the cases where intensity and majority preference diverge.

Wren leads the Scoring Round (21) **and** wins the Automatic Runoff 4–1. Source: <https://bettervoting.com/d664xw/results>.

**Result — Scoring Round + Automatic Runoff:**

![BetterVoting result for d664xw: Wren wins; Scoring Round bars (Wren 21, Yarrow 13, Zinnia 6); Automatic Runoff Wren 80% vs Yarrow 20% — the leader confirmed](img/d664xw_result_bars.png)

**Why there's no reversal.** Wren has the most stars (21) *and* is the head-to-head favorite: four of the five voters score Wren above Yarrow. So *how much* and *how many* agree, and the runoff confirms the leader. The runoff didn't change the answer — but it asked the question, which is the safeguard. A reversal only happens when those two point at **different** candidates; here they don't.

```
[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Wren — matches the STAR winner

Scoring Round
   Wren          -- 21 -- First place
   Yarrow        -- 13 -- Second place
   Zinnia        --  6
 Wren and Yarrow advance.

Automatic Runoff Round
   Wren          -- 4 -- First place
   Yarrow        -- 1
   Equal Support -- 0
 Wren wins.
   Voters with a preference: 5 of 5 (no Equal Support).
   Wren 4 (80%) vs Yarrow 1 (20%); majority = 3.
```

(No "Majority Preference Enforcement" line here — that block only prints when the score winner and the runoff winner *differ*. They agree, so it stays silent.)

> **BV ↔ LH wording.** The line `Wren 4 (80%) vs Yarrow 1 (20%)` is BetterVoting's *Runoff Votes* (4 / 1) and *% Between Finalists* (80% / 20%) folded into one line — LH names its denominator (`Voters with a preference`) instead of using table columns.

## The takeaway — and the whole set

The runoff is not biased against the leader; it *checks* the leader, and usually confirms them. The point of the second step is the times it doesn't (Runoff_02–05), where a passionate or broadly-liked leader on *stars* loses to the candidate more voters actually *prefer*. Confirm or reverse, BetterVoting and the LH engine agree on every number — and the rule is always the same: **stars find the finalists; the runoff counts who the majority prefers.**
