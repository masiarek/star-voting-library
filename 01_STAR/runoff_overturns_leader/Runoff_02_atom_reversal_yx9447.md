# Runoff 02 — the atom (smallest runoff reversal)

**Level 101 · the smallest reversal there is.** Three voters. Everyone *likes* Austin (scores 5, 4, 4 — the most stars), but two of the three *prefer* Boston, so the Automatic Runoff hands it to **Boston**. The Scoring-Round leader **loses** — and that's the runoff doing its job. (Boston is also the Condorcet winner — no startling case.)

The contrast: in [Runoff 01](Runoff_01_confirms_leader_r2pvc9.md) the same machinery *confirmed* the leader. The runoff only changes the answer when raw stars and majority preference point at different candidates.

## View 1 — BetterVoting

Austin leads the Scoring Round (13) but **loses** the Automatic Runoff 1–2; BetterVoting flags this with its "why is the top scorer different from the winner?" note. Source: <https://bettervoting.com/yx9447/results>.

**Result — Scoring Round + Automatic Runoff:** ![BetterVoting result for yx9447: Boston wins; Scoring Round bars (Boston 11, Austin 13, Cairo 2); Automatic Runoff Boston 67% vs Austin 33%; with BetterVoting's "why is the top scoring candidate different from the winner?" popover](img/yx9447_result_popover.png)

**A clearer answer for this result.** BetterVoting's popover (in the screenshot above) is vague. Here's the concrete reason Austin lost, from these three ballots: everyone scored Austin high — a 5 and two 4s, **13 stars** in all — but two of the three voters scored **Boston a 5 and Austin a 4**. They like Austin; they *prefer* Boston. The scoring round can't tell a first choice from a strong second choice — a 4 looks the same either way — so Austin's lead is built partly from two "Austin is my solid #2" ballots. The runoff asks each voter to pick between the two finalists, and **2 of 3 pick Boston**, so Boston wins the head-to-head 2-1. Stars measure *how much* you like each candidate; the runoff measures *who you actually prefer.*

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Boston — matches the STAR winner

Majority Preference Enforcement Principle:
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Austin)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Boston)
  Austin earned the highest total score, but Boston won the automatic
  runoff by being the head-to-head majority favorite.

Scoring Round
   Austin        -- 13 -- First place
   Boston        -- 11 -- Second place
   Cairo         --  2
 Austin and Boston advance.

Automatic Runoff Round
   Boston        -- 2 -- First place
   Austin        -- 1
   Equal Support -- 0
 Boston wins.
   Voters with a preference: 3 of 3 (no Equal Support).
   Boston 2 (67%) vs Austin 1 (33%); majority = 2.
```

> **BV ↔ LH wording.** The line `Boston 2 (67%) vs Austin 1 (33%)` is BetterVoting's *Runoff Votes* (2 / 1) and *% Between Finalists* (67% / 33%) folded into one line — LH names its denominator (`Voters with a preference`) instead of using table columns. [Why the words differ →](../../00_start_here/STAR_reporting/reporting_diff_BV_LH.md#same-numbers-different-words)

## The takeaway

Stars choose the two **finalists**; the runoff chooses the **winner** as the finalist more voters prefer. Nothing was rigged — the runoff just asked the majority question that raw totals can't, and BetterVoting and the LH engine agree on every number. In [Runoff 01](Runoff_01_confirms_leader_r2pvc9.md) the same machinery *confirmed* the leader; the only difference is whether intensity and majority preference point at the same candidate.
