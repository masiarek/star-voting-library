# Runoff 01 — Runoff confirms the leader (control)

*Generated from [`Runoff_01_confirms_leader_r2pvc9.yaml`](../Runoff_01_confirms_leader_r2pvc9.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Aspen

## Scenario

A REAL BetterVoting election (BV id r2pvc9), captured 2026-06-28. The control
case for the Runoff Reversal set: the Scoring-Round leader (Aspen) is ALSO the
candidate more voters prefer head-to-head, so the runoff CONFIRMS the leader —
proof the runoff isn't rigged against whoever has the most stars. Winner = the
Condorcet winner. Level 101. Full two-view lesson: Runoff_01_confirms_leader_r2pvc9.md

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

Aspen, Birch, Cedar
