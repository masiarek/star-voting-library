## Scenario

A REAL BetterVoting election (BV id bfjqmg), captured 2026-06-28. The atom
(Runoff_02) blown up to a real crowd: three voters love Maple (5s) and push
Maple's total to the top of the Scoring Round (39), but six voters prefer Olive,
so Olive wins the Automatic Runoff 6-3 — a clean 2-to-1 majority (67/33). Proof
a reversal isn't a small-numbers fluke. Maple leads on HOW MUCH; Olive wins on
HOW MANY. Winner = the Condorcet winner. Level 101. Full two-view lesson:

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Olive — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Olive
  Approval = Maple   (differs from STAR)

Majority Preference Enforcement Principle:
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Maple)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Olive)
  Candidate Maple earned the highest total score,
  but Candidate Olive won the automatic runoff by being the head-to-head majority favorite.
