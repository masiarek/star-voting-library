# Five candidates — the score leader is overturned in the runoff

*Generated from [`02_c5_b5_leader-overturned.yaml`](../02_c5_b5_leader-overturned.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Boston

## Scenario

Five candidates, five voters. Austin is the high-ceiling favorite — its two fans
rate it 5 and the rest still give a respectful 4 — so Austin leads the scoring
round with 22 stars. But Boston is the broad compromise and the real majority pick:
three of the five prefer Boston to Austin, so Boston takes the automatic runoff 3-2.
Chicago, Denver and Erie are genuine options that simply don't reach the final two.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Austin, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Erie
     5,      0,       1,      0,    2
     5,      0,       0,      1,    0
     4,      5,       1,      0,    0
     4,      5,       0,      2,    0

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Boston — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Boston
  Approval = Austin   (differs from STAR)

[Runoff Reversal]
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Austin)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Boston)
  Candidate Austin earned the highest total score, but
  Candidate Boston won the automatic runoff — not a malfunction,
  STAR working as designed: the runoff elects the finalist preferred
  by the majority (of voters with a preference).
