# Runoff 07 (WIP) — flat ballot exposes the BV abstention bug

*Generated from [`Runoff_07_flat_ballot_bv_bug_tf73v9.yaml`](../Runoff_07_flat_ballot_bv_bug_tf73v9.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Blair

## Scenario

⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS — illustration pending a BetterVoting fix
(Equal-Vote/bettervoting#1407). A REAL BetterVoting election (BV id tf73v9),
captured 2026-06-28. A reversal (Alex leads the scoring round, Blair wins the
runoff) that ALSO contains a flat ballot (3,3,3). The two reports AGREE on the
winner (Blair) but DISAGREE on the bookkeeping: the LH engine counts all 4
ballots and treats the 3,3,3 as Equal Support; BetterVoting files the 3,3,3 as an
ABSTENTION (nAbstentions = 1, nTallyVotes = 3) and drops its 3 stars from every
candidate's total. This is the flat-ballot abstention bug, now inside a reversal.
Level 201/301. Full two-view lesson: Runoff_07_flat_ballot_bv_bug_tf73v9.md

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Alex, Blair, Cleo
5, 1, 2
4, 5, 0
4, 5, 0
3, 3, 3
```

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Blair — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Blair
  Approval = Alex   (differs from STAR)

Majority Preference Enforcement Principle:
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Alex)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Blair)
  Candidate Alex earned the highest total score,
  but Candidate Blair won the automatic runoff by being the head-to-head majority favorite.


--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---
[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 4 ballots.
Count × Alex,Blair,Cleo
    2 ×    4,    5,   0
    1 ×    5,    1,   2
    1 ×    3,    3,   3

[Score Distribution] (how many ballots gave each star rating)
                Score
Candidate  5  4  3  2  1  0  | Total   Avg
Alex       1  2  1  0  0  0  |    16   4.0
Blair      2  0  1  0  1  0  |    14   3.5
Cleo       0  0  1  1  0  2  |     5   1.3

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Alex          -- 16 -- First place
   Blair         -- 14 -- Second place
   Cleo          --  5
 Alex and Blair advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Blair         -- 2 -- First place
   Alex          -- 1
   Equal Support -- 1
 Blair wins.
   Runoff math:
     4  ballots cast
   − 1  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     3  voters with a preference  (majority = 2)
           Blair 2 (67%)  ·  Alex 1 (33%)

[STAR Voting: Winner — STAR Voting Method (single winner)]
 Blair
