# Runoff 03 — two enthusiasts vs the majority

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Eden

## Scenario

A REAL BetterVoting election (BV id rkgtpk), captured 2026-06-28. A reversal in a
five-candidate field, the "narrow-but-deep" pattern: two voters are Dakota
enthusiasts (Dakota 5), and their intensity pushes Dakota to the top of the
Scoring Round (22). But the other three voters score Eden 5 over Dakota 4 — they
like Dakota, prefer Eden — so 3 of 5 pick Eden in the runoff. Dakota leads on HOW
MUCH (intensity); Eden wins on HOW MANY (majority). Winner = the Condorcet winner
(calm case). Level 201. Full two-view lesson: Runoff_03_enthusiasts_vs_majority_rkgtpk.md

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Dakota, Eden, Flynn, Gale, Hazel
5, 0, 1, 0, 0
5, 0, 0, 1, 0
4, 5, 0, 0, 1
4, 5, 1, 0, 0
4, 5, 0, 1, 0
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Eden
  Approval = Dakota   (differs from STAR)

[Runoff Reversal]
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Dakota)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Eden)
  Candidate Dakota earned the highest total score, but
  Candidate Eden won the automatic runoff — not a malfunction,
  STAR working as designed: the runoff elects the finalist preferred
  by the majority (of voters with a preference).
