**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Brownie

## Scenario

Same election as 01a, just more voters — proof the three-person version wasn't a
fluke. Three Almond superfans (5 stars) against six who prefer Brownie. Almond
still leads the scoring round (39 to 33), and Brownie still wins the automatic
runoff — now 6-3, a clean 67% to 33%. The pattern doesn't depend on small numbers.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Almond, Brownie, Cocoa
     5,       1,     0

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Brownie — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Brownie
  Approval = Almond   (differs from STAR)

Majority Preference Enforcement Principle:
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Almond)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Brownie)
  Candidate Almond earned the highest total score,
  but Candidate Brownie won the automatic runoff by being the head-to-head majority favorite.
