# Runoff 05 — reversal with Equal Support

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Sage

## Scenario

A REAL BetterVoting election (BV id xgkw3w), captured 2026-06-28. The first
reversal where some voters have NO PREFERENCE between the two finalists. Rosa
leads the Scoring Round (21), but two voters scored Rosa and Sage equally (3,3
and 5,5) — Equal Support — so they sit out the runoff. Of the three voters who DID
pick between the finalists, two prefer Sage, so Sage wins. The runoff line reads
"3 of 5 (2 Equal Support)" — the bridge to the two-denominator idea. Both
equal-support voters rated Tulip (a 1 and a 2), so they are CAST votes, not
abstentions — BetterVoting and LH agree (nAbstentions = 0). Winner = the Condorcet
winner. Level 201. Full two-view lesson: Runoff_05_reversal_with_equal_support_xgkw3w.md

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Rosa, Sage, Tulip
5, 1, 0
4, 5, 0
4, 5, 0
3, 3, 1
5, 5, 2

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Sage — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Sage
  Approval = Rosa   (differs from STAR)

[Runoff Reversal]
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Rosa)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Sage)
  Candidate Rosa earned the highest total score, but
  Candidate Sage won the automatic runoff — not a malfunction,
  STAR working as designed: the runoff elects the finalist preferred
  by the majority (of voters with a preference).


--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---
[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 5 ballots.
Count × Rosa,Sage,Tulip
    2 ×    4,   5,    0
    1 ×    5,   1,    0
    1 ×    3,   3,    1
    1 ×    5,   5,    2

[Score Distribution] (how many ballots gave each star rating)
                Score
Candidate  5  4  3  2  1  0  | Total   Avg
Rosa       2  2  1  0  0  0  |    21   4.2
Sage       3  0  1  0  1  0  |    19   3.8
Tulip      0  0  0  1  1  3  |     3   0.6

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Rosa          -- 21 -- First place
   Sage          -- 19 -- Second place
   Tulip         --  3
 Rosa and Sage advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Sage          -- 2 -- First place
   Rosa          -- 1
   Equal Support -- 2
 Sage wins.
   Runoff math:
     5  ballots cast
   − 2  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     3  voters with a preference  (majority = 2)
           Sage 2 (67%)  ·  Rosa 1 (33%)
