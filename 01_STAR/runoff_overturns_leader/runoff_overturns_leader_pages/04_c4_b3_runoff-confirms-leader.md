# The control case — here the runoff CONFIRMS the score leader

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Blue

## Scenario

Same machinery, opposite result — and that's the point. Blue is both the biggest
star pile (14) AND the majority's preferred finalist, so the automatic runoff
simply confirms the scoring leader: Blue wins either way.

This is why STAR's runoff isn't "rigged against front-runners." It only overturns
the leader when the star total and the head-to-head majority disagree (01a-03);
when the leader really is the most-preferred candidate, the leader wins.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Amber, Blue, Coral, Dune
    2,    5,     1,    0
    2,    5,     0,    1
    5,    4,     0,    0
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Blue          -- 14 -- First place
   Amber         --  9 -- Second place
   Coral         --  1
   Dune          --  1
 Blue and Amber advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Blue          -- 2 -- First place
   Amber         -- 1
   Equal Support -- 0
 Blue wins.
   Runoff math:

     3  voters with a preference  (majority = 2)
           Blue 2 (67%)  ·  Amber 1 (33%)
