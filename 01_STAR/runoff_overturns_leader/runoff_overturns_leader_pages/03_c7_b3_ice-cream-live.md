# Ice Cream — Flavor of the Year (the real recorded race)

*Generated from [`03_c7_b3_ice-cream-live.yaml`](../03_c7_b3_ice-cream-live.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** ChocoAlm

## Scenario

The actual recorded election (BetterVoting id 4c7kp9). ChocoDrk wins the scoring
round with 9 stars — one voter adores it (5). But the automatic runoff is between
the two finalists, ChocoDrk and ChocoAlm, and two of the three voters prefer
ChocoAlm, so ChocoAlm wins 2-1 (67% to 33%).

This is exactly the "why isn't the top-scoring candidate the winner?" moment STAR
is built to answer: the scoring round finds the two finalists; the runoff lets each
voter's full vote back the finalist they actually prefer.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
ChocoDrk, ChocoAlm, ChocoHzn, VanillaClssc, VanillaFrnch, Mango, Peach
       4,        5,        3,            0,            1,     2,     0
       0,        3,        0,            0,            0,     0,     0
       5,        0,        0,            0,            0,     0,     0
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = ChocoAlm
  Approval = ChocoDrk   (differs from STAR)

[Runoff Reversal]
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (ChocoDrk)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (ChocoAlm)
  Candidate ChocoDrk earned the highest total score, but
  Candidate ChocoAlm won the automatic runoff — not a malfunction,
  STAR working as designed: the runoff elects the finalist preferred
  by the majority (of voters with a preference).
