**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Wren

## Scenario

A REAL BetterVoting election (BV id d664xw), captured 2026-06-28. The closing
control: the Scoring-Round leader (Wren) is ALSO the candidate most voters prefer
head-to-head, so the Automatic Runoff confirms the leader, 4-1. After four
reversals, this is the reassurance — *how much* and *how many* point at the same
candidate, so the runoff just agrees with the score round. Winner = the Condorcet
winner. The bookend to Runoff_01. Level 101. Full two-view lesson:

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

Wren, Yarrow, Zinnia
5, 2, 0
