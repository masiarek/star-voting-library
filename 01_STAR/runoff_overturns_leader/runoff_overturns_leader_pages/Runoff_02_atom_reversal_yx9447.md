**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Boston

## Scenario

A REAL BetterVoting election (BV id yx9447), captured 2026-06-28. The smallest
possible Runoff Reversal: the Scoring-Round leader (Austin) LOSES the Automatic
Runoff to Boston, the candidate more voters prefer head-to-head. All three voters
like Austin (5, 4, 4), but two of them prefer Boston (Boston 5 over Austin 4), so
Boston wins the runoff 2-1. Winner = the Condorcet winner (not a startling case).
Level 101. Full two-view lesson: Runoff_02_atom_reversal_yx9447.md

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Austin, Boston, Cairo
5, 1, 2

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Boston — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Boston
  Approval = Austin   (differs from STAR)

Majority Preference Enforcement Principle:
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Austin)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Boston)
  Candidate Austin earned the highest total score,
  but Candidate Boston won the automatic runoff by being the head-to-head majority favorite.


--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---
[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 3 ballots.
Count × Austin,Boston,Cairo
    2 ×      4,     5,    0
    1 ×      5,     1,    2

[Score Distribution] (number of ballots giving each score)
        5  4  3  2  1  0  | Total   Avg
Austin  1  2  0  0  0  0  |    13   4.3
Boston  2  0  0  0  1  0  |    11   3.7
Cairo   0  0  0  1  0  2  |     2   0.7

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Austin        -- 13 -- First place
   Boston        -- 11 -- Second place
   Cairo         --  2
 Austin and Boston advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Boston        -- 2 -- First place
   Austin        -- 1
   Equal Support -- 0
 Boston wins.
   Runoff math:
     3  ballots cast
   − 0  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     3  voters with a preference  (majority = 2)
           Boston 2 (67%)  ·  Austin 1 (33%)
