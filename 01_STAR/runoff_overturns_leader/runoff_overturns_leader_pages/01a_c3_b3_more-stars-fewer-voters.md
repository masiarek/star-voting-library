# More stars, fewer voters — the runoff overturns the score leader

*Generated from [`01a_c3_b3_more-stars-fewer-voters.yaml`](../01a_c3_b3_more-stars-fewer-voters.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Brownie

## Scenario

The whole lesson in three voters. Almond is the star-magnet: one fan rates it 5,
so Almond tops the scoring round with 13 stars. But STAR doesn't crown the biggest
star pile — it asks the finalists' question: of the top two, Almond and Brownie,
which one do MORE voters prefer? Two of the three rank Brownie above Almond, so
Brownie wins the automatic runoff 2-1.

More stars from fewer people loses to fewer stars from more people. (Cocoa is only
here so the runoff is picking finalists out of a real field, not a forced pair.)

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Almond, Brownie, Cocoa
     5,       1,     2
     4,       5,     0
     4,       5,     0
```

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Brownie — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Brownie
  Approval = Almond   (differs from STAR)

[Runoff Reversal]
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Almond)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Brownie)
  Candidate Almond earned the highest total score, but
  Candidate Brownie won the automatic runoff — not a malfunction,
  STAR working as designed: the runoff elects the finalist preferred
  by the majority (of voters with a preference).


--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---
[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 3 ballots.
Count × Almond,Brownie,Cocoa
    2 ×      4,      5,    0
    1 ×      5,      1,    2

[Score Distribution] (how many ballots gave each star rating)
                Score
Candidate  5  4  3  2  1  0  | Total   Avg
Almond     1  2  0  0  0  0  |    13   4.3

Cocoa      0  0  0  1  0  2  |     2   0.7

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Almond        -- 13 -- First place
   Brownie       -- 11 -- Second place
   Cocoa         --  2
 Almond and Brownie advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Brownie       -- 2 -- First place
   Almond        -- 1
   Equal Support -- 0
 Brownie wins.
   Runoff math:
     3  ballots cast
   − 0  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     3  voters with a preference  (majority = 2)
           Brownie 2 (67%)  ·  Almond 1 (33%)
