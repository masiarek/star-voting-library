# Runoff 05 — reversal with Equal Support

**Level 201 · the first reversal where some voters have no preference.** Rosa leads the Scoring Round (21), but two voters scored **Rosa and Sage equally** — *Equal Support* — so they sit out the runoff. Of the **three** who did pick between the finalists, two prefer **Sage**, so Sage wins. The runoff is decided by **3 of 5** voters, not all five — the bridge to the two-denominator idea.

Rosa leads the Scoring Round (21) but **loses** the Automatic Runoff 1–2, with **2 Equal Support**. Source: <https://bettervoting.com/xgkw3w/results>.

**Result — Scoring Round + Automatic Runoff (with BetterVoting's popover):**

![BetterVoting result for xgkw3w: Sage wins; Scoring Round bars (Rosa 21, Sage 19, Tulip 3); Automatic Runoff percentage view (Sage 40%, Rosa 20%, Equal Support 40% — out of all five voters); with BetterVoting's "why is the top scoring candidate different from the winner?" popover](img/xgkw3w_result_popover.png)

**Why the denominator isn't five.** Two voters scored Rosa and Sage the **same** (3-3 and 5-5): they like both finalists equally, so they have *no preference* in this head-to-head and are set aside as **Equal Support**. That leaves **3 voters** deciding the runoff. Rosa still has the most stars (21) — those equal-support ballots counted fully in the Scoring Round — but among the three who *picked*, two prefer Sage, so Sage wins 2–1. The summary line says it exactly: **`3 of 5 (2 Equal Support)`** — a majority of the **decided** voters, not of everyone. (Because both equal-support voters rated Tulip, they're cast votes, not abstentions — so BetterVoting and LH agree.)

**The same runoff, other views (raw votes, and pie):**

Watch the Runoff Table here: **% Between Finalists** is out of 3 (67% / 33%), but **% Runoff Votes** is out of all 5 — the two denominators side by side. ([Runoff percentages](../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting/runoff_percentages.md).)

```
[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Sage — matches the STAR winner

[Runoff Reversal]
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Rosa)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Sage)
  Candidate Rosa earned the highest total score, but
  Candidate Sage won the automatic runoff — not a malfunction,
  STAR working as designed: the runoff elects the finalist preferred
  by the majority (of voters with a preference).

Scoring Round
   Rosa          -- 21 -- First place
   Sage          -- 19 -- Second place
   Tulip         --  3
 Rosa and Sage advance.

Automatic Runoff Round
   Sage          -- 2 -- First place
   Rosa          -- 1
   Equal Support -- 2
 Sage wins.
   Voters with a preference: 3 of 5 (2 Equal Support).
   Sage 2 (67%) vs Rosa 1 (33%); majority = 2.
```

> **BV ↔ LH wording.** `3 of 5 (2 Equal Support). Sage 2 (67%) vs Rosa 1 (33%)` packs BetterVoting's *Runoff Votes* (2 / 1), *% Between Finalists* (67% / 33%), and the Equal-Support count (2) into one line that names its denominator. [Why the words differ →](../../00_start_here/STAR_reporting/reporting_diff_BV_LH.md#same-numbers-different-words)

## The takeaway

A reversal and a real Equal-Support split in one election: the runoff sets aside the voters with no preference between the finalists and asks the rest *how many* prefer each. Rosa's bigger total can't override the majority of the **decided** voters, who chose Sage. Both reports agree on every number — and now you can read the `N of TOTAL (E Equal Support)` line for what it is.
