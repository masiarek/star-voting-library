# Flat scores 06 — scoring-round 4-way tie (ties at every step)

*Generated from [`Flat_scores_ties_06_scoring_tie_4way.yaml`](../Flat_scores_ties_06_scoring_tie_4way.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Ava

## Scenario

Ava, Ben, Cara, Dan tie at 10; ties persist through every score-based tiebreaker, the
lot picks two finalists, and the runoff also ties -> lot again -> Ava. BV bugs: 'no
ballots cast' under multi-step ties (BV126 #1052); wrong finalists #1379; tie-break export #1371 (closed).
Level 301. Lesson: Flat_scores_ties_06_scoring_tie_4way.md  (BV id pending).

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Ava, Ben, Cara, Dan, Eve
5, 5, 5, 5, 1

```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---

[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 2 ballots.
Count × Ava,Ben,Cara,Dan,Eve
    2 ×   5,  5,   5,  5,  1

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Ava           -- 10 -- Tied for first place
   Ben           -- 10 -- Tied for first place
   Cara          -- 10 -- Tied for first place
   Dan           -- 10 -- Tied for first place
   Eve           --  2
 There's a four-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round: First tiebreaker]
 The two candidates preferred in the most head-to-head matchups advance.
   Ava           -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Ben           -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Cara          -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Dan           -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Equal Support -- 2
 There's still a four-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round: Second tiebreaker]
 The two candidates with the most votes of score 5 advance.
   Ava           -- 2 -- Tied for first place
   Ben           -- 2 -- Tied for first place
   Cara          -- 2 -- Tied for first place
   Dan           -- 2 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a four-way tie for first.

*(Ties are resolved by choosing the tied candidate with the highest-priority official lot number.)*
    Lot-number priority order: ['Ava', 'Ben', 'Cara', 'Dan', 'Eve']

[Tiebreaker: Lot Number Priority]
  Tie among: ['Ava', 'Ben', 'Cara', 'Dan']
  Resolved: ['Ava', 'Ben'] (selected by lot-number priority).

[Lot-decided tie — rare]
  ⚠ The ballots did not break this tie: the deterministic rungs
    (pairwise / score, then five-star) all came back equal, so the
    pre-published LOT order chose among the tied candidates — the
    result here was set by lot, not by the votes. Usually the
    "dead rung": no tied candidate held a score-5 vote (five-star
    counts fives, not fours). Verify the tied candidates' 5-counts.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Ava           -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Ben           -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Equal Support -- 2
 There's a two-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round: First tiebreaker]
 The highest-scoring candidate wins.
   Ava           -- 10 -- Tied for first place
   Ben           -- 10 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a two-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round: Second tiebreaker]
 The candidate with the most votes of score 5 wins.
   Ava           -- 2 -- Tied for first place
   Ben           -- 2 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a two-way tie for first.

[Tiebreaker: Lot Number Priority]
  Tie among: ['Ava', 'Ben']
  Resolved: ['Ava'] (selected by lot-number priority).

[Lot-decided tie — rare]
  ⚠ The ballots did not break this tie: the deterministic rungs
