# Flat scores 04 — scoring-round tie for the 2nd finalist slot (2-way)

*Generated from [`Flat_scores_ties_04_scoring_tie_2way.yaml`](../Flat_scores_ties_04_scoring_tie_2way.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Aral

## Scenario

Aral leads outright; Baikal and Crater tie for the second finalist slot. The cascade
(head-to-head -> most 5s -> lot) advances Baikal; Aral then wins the runoff cleanly.
BV bugs: wrong finalists #1379; lot rule #1063; tie-break export #1371 (closed). Level 201.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Aral, Baikal, Crater
5, 4, 4
5, 4, 4
5, 0, 0
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---

[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 3 ballots.
Count × Aral,Baikal,Crater
    2 ×    5,     4,     4
    1 ×    5,     0,     0

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Aral          -- 15 -- First place
   Baikal        --  8 -- Tied for second place
   Crater        --  8 -- Tied for second place
 Aral advances, but there's a two-way tie for second.

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round: First tiebreaker]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups advances.
   Baikal        -- 0 -- Tied for second place
   Crater        -- 0 -- Tied for second place
   Equal Support -- 3
 There's still a two-way tie for second.

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round: Second tiebreaker]
 The candidate with the most votes of score 5 advances.
   Baikal        -- 0 -- Tied for second place
   Crater        -- 0 -- Tied for second place
 There's still a two-way tie for second.

*(Ties are resolved by choosing the tied candidate with the highest-priority official lot number.)*
    Lot-number priority order: ['Aral', 'Baikal', 'Crater']

[Tiebreaker: Lot Number Priority]
  Tie among: ['Baikal', 'Crater']
  Resolved: ['Baikal'] (selected by lot-number priority).

[Lot-decided tie — rare]
  ⚠ The ballots did not break this tie: the deterministic rungs
    (pairwise / score, then five-star) all came back equal, so the
    pre-published LOT order chose among the tied candidates — the
    result here was set by lot, not by the votes. Usually the
    "dead rung": no tied candidate held a score-5 vote (five-star
    counts fives, not fours). Verify the tied candidates' 5-counts.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Aral          -- 3 -- First place
   Baikal        -- 0
   Equal Support -- 0
 Aral wins.
   Runoff math:
     3  ballots cast
   − 0  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     3  voters with a preference  (majority = 2)
           Aral 3 (100%)  ·  Baikal 0 (0%)

[STAR Voting: Winner — STAR Voting Method (single winner)]
 Aral
```
