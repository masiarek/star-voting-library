# Flat scores 03 — runoff tie, an even 1-1 split

*Generated from [`Flat_scores_ties_03_runoff_tie_split.yaml`](../Flat_scores_ties_03_runoff_tie_split.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Athens

## Scenario

Two capitals chosen cleanly, then the runoff splits 1-1 (real opposing preferences).
Broken by highest score -> most 5s -> lot -> Athens. Level 201.
Lesson: Flat_scores_ties_03_runoff_tie_split.md  (BV id pending).

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Athens, Berlin, Cairo
5, 4, 0
4, 5, 0
```

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Athens        -- 9 -- First place
   Berlin        -- 9 -- Second place
   Cairo         -- 0
 Athens and Berlin advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Athens        -- 1 -- Tied for first place
   Berlin        -- 1 -- Tied for first place
   Equal Support -- 0
 There's a two-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round: First tiebreaker]
 The highest-scoring candidate wins.
   Athens        -- 9 -- Tied for first place
   Berlin        -- 9 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a two-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round: Second tiebreaker]
 The candidate with the most votes of score 5 wins.
   Athens        -- 1 -- Tied for first place
   Berlin        -- 1 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a two-way tie for first.

*(Ties are resolved by choosing the tied candidate with the highest-priority official lot number.)*
    Lot-number priority order: ['Athens', 'Berlin', 'Cairo']

[Tiebreaker: Lot Number Priority]
  Tie among: ['Athens', 'Berlin']
  Resolved: ['Athens'] (selected by lot-number priority).

[Lot-decided tie — rare]
  ⚠ The ballots did not break this tie: the deterministic rungs
    (pairwise / score, then five-star) all came back equal, so the
    pre-published LOT order chose among the tied candidates — the
    result here was set by lot, not by the votes. Usually the
    "dead rung": no tied candidate held a score-5 vote (five-star
    counts fives, not fours). Verify the tied candidates' 5-counts.
