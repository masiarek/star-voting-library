# Flat scores 08 — every ballot flat (BetterVoting counts 0)

*Generated from [`Flat_scores_ties_08_all_flat_zero_count.yaml`](../Flat_scores_ties_08_all_flat_zero_count.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Anchovy

## Scenario

Five voters, every ballot FLAT at a different level: 1s..5s. Each pizza totals 15 — a
3-way tie LH resolves by lot to Anchovy. BetterVoting mis-files ALL FIVE as abstentions,
so its ballot count reads 0. Intersects #1407, BV126 #1052, BV200 #1035. Level 301.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Anchovy       -- 15 -- Tied for first place
   Basil         -- 15 -- Tied for first place
   Caper         -- 15 -- Tied for first place
 There's a three-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round: First tiebreaker]
 The two candidates preferred in the most head-to-head matchups advance.
   Anchovy       -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Basil         -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Caper         -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Equal Support -- 5
 There's still a three-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round: Second tiebreaker]
 The two candidates with the most votes of score 5 advance.
   Anchovy       -- 1 -- Tied for first place
   Basil         -- 1 -- Tied for first place
   Caper         -- 1 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a three-way tie for first.

*(Ties are resolved by choosing the tied candidate with the highest-priority official lot number.)*
    Lot-number priority order: ['Anchovy', 'Basil', 'Caper']

[Tiebreaker: Lot Number Priority]
  Tie among: ['Anchovy', 'Basil', 'Caper']
  Resolved: ['Anchovy', 'Basil'] (selected by lot-number priority).

[Lot-decided tie — rare]
  ⚠ The ballots did not break this tie: the deterministic rungs
    (pairwise / score, then five-star) all came back equal, so the
    pre-published LOT order chose among the tied candidates — the
    result here was set by lot, not by the votes. Usually the
    "dead rung": no tied candidate held a score-5 vote (five-star
    counts fives, not fours). Verify the tied candidates' 5-counts.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Anchovy       -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Basil         -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Equal Support -- 5
 There's a two-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round: First tiebreaker]
 The highest-scoring candidate wins.
   Anchovy       -- 15 -- Tied for first place
   Basil         -- 15 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a two-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round: Second tiebreaker]
 The candidate with the most votes of score 5 wins.
   Anchovy       -- 1 -- Tied for first place
   Basil         -- 1 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a two-way tie for first.

[Tiebreaker: Lot Number Priority]
