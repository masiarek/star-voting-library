# Flat scores 05 — scoring-round 3-way tie (BV555 /

*Generated from [`Flat_scores_ties_05_scoring_tie_3way_xmyf7k.yaml`](../Flat_scores_ties_05_scoring_tie_3way_xmyf7k.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** A

## Scenario

THE documented bug case. A, B, C tie at 10; every score-based tiebreaker stays
tied; the lot-number fallback picks A, B as finalists and A wins. BetterVoting
(xmyf7k) instead picks C and A and declares C the winner, and exports NO
tie-break explanation. Same ballots, different winner -> a real divergence.
Tracked: BV555 #1379 (wrong finalists + missing explanation), #1371 closed (JSON
sequence), #1063 (lot-number tie-break). Level 201/301. WORK IN PROGRESS until
BV is fixed. Lesson: Flat_scores_ties_05_scoring_tie_3way_xmyf7k.md

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
A, B, C, D, E
