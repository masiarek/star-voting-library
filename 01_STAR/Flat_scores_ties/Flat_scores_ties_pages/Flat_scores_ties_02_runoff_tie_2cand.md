# Flat scores 02 — runoff tie, two candidates (everyone equal)

*Generated from [`Flat_scores_ties_02_runoff_tie_2cand.yaml`](../Flat_scores_ties_02_runoff_tie_2cand.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Almond

## Scenario

Two ice-cream flavors, both scored 5 by everyone: both advance, the runoff is 0-0
Equal Support, and the cascade (highest score -> most 5s -> lot) picks Almond. BV bugs:
NaN/equal-ties #1035; lot rule #1063; tie-break export #1371 (closed). Level 101.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---

[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 2 ballots.
Count × Almond,Brownie
    2 ×      5,      5

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Almond        -- 10 -- First place
   Brownie       -- 10 -- Second place
 Almond and Brownie advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Almond        -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Brownie       -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Equal Support -- 2
 There's a two-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round: First tiebreaker]
 The highest-scoring candidate wins.
   Almond        -- 10 -- Tied for first place
   Brownie       -- 10 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a two-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round: Second tiebreaker]
 The candidate with the most votes of score 5 wins.
   Almond        -- 2 -- Tied for first place
   Brownie       -- 2 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a two-way tie for first.

*(Ties are resolved by choosing the tied candidate with the highest-priority official lot number.)*
    Lot-number priority order: ['Almond', 'Brownie']

[Tiebreaker: Lot Number Priority]
  Tie among: ['Almond', 'Brownie']
  Resolved: ['Almond'] (selected by lot-number priority).

[Lot-decided tie — rare]
  ⚠ The ballots did not break this tie: the deterministic rungs
    (pairwise / score, then five-star) all came back equal, so the
    pre-published LOT order chose among the tied candidates — the
    result here was set by lot, not by the votes. Usually the
    "dead rung": no tied candidate held a score-5 vote (five-star
    counts fives, not fours). Verify the tied candidates' 5-counts.

[STAR Voting: Winner — STAR Voting Method (single winner)]
