# Flat scores 02 — runoff tie, two candidates (everyone equal)

**Level 101 · the smallest tie there is.** Two ice-cream flavors, both scored **5** by every voter. Both advance (there are only two), the runoff is **0–0 Equal Support**, and the **tie-break cascade** decides: highest score (tied) → most 5s (tied) → **lot number** → Almond.

> ⚠️ **BV reporting bug (pending).** On equal ties and equal preferences BetterVoting can display **`NaN`** instead of a clean tie result — tracked as **[BV200 / #1035](https://github.com/Equal-Vote/bettervoting/issues/1035)**. BV **now exports** its tie-break sequence ([#1371](https://github.com/Equal-Vote/bettervoting/issues/1371), recently added), so the result is reproducible by importing that order; the remaining ask is a **pre-published** lot number rather than a random shuffle ([#1063](https://github.com/Equal-Vote/bettervoting/issues/1063)).

## The ballots (2 voters)

```
Almond, Brownie
5, 5
5, 5

## What LH does

Both flavors total 10 and both advance. In the runoff every ballot scored Almond and Brownie **equally**, so both are **Equal Support** — the runoff is 0–0. The cascade runs: **highest score** (10 = 10, tied), **most 5s** (2 = 2, tied), then the **lot number** picks Almond (highest priority). Deterministic and fully explained.

## View 1 — BetterVoting (bug pending)

BV should report a clean two-way tie resolved by lot; instead watch for **`NaN`** in the runoff display ([#1035](https://github.com/Equal-Vote/bettervoting/issues/1035)).

 There's a two-way tie for first.

 First tiebreaker (highest score):  Almond 10 = Brownie 10   → still tied
 Second tiebreaker (most 5s):       Almond  2 = Brownie  2   → still tied

## The takeaway

A pure flat ballot is a *cast vote with no preference* (Equal Support), not an abstention — and an all-equal runoff is resolved, not undefined. The number the cascade lands on (Almond by lot) is reproducible by anyone with the published lot order. `NaN` is a display bug, not the math.
