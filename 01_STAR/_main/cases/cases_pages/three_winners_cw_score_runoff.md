# Three notions of "winner" disagree — Condorcet, Score, and Runoff

*Generated from [`three_winners_cw_score_runoff.yaml`](../three_winners_cw_score_runoff.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Bob

## Scenario

One tiny election, three different "winners" depending on what you mean by the word.
Five voters, three candidates (Ann, Bob, Carl):

 - Condorcet winner = ANN — she beats both Bob and Carl one-on-one (3 of 5 prefer
   her each time). The "beats everyone head-to-head" winner.
 - Score winner = CARL — he has the most total stars (19). The "highest intensity /
   utility favorite" winner.
 - STAR winner = BOB — the Scoring Round sends the top two (Carl 19, Bob 18) to the
   Automatic Runoff, and a 3-2 majority prefers Bob there. The "broad compromise the
   majority actually picks between the finalists" winner.

No method is malfunctioning — they optimize for different things. STAR deliberately
lands on Bob: it uses scores to FIND the finalists, then a majority runoff to CHOOSE
between them. (Ann is shut out only because she's edged for second place in the
scoring round — a reminder STAR is not a Condorcet method, by design.)

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Ann, Bob, Carl
  5,   4,    3
  5,   4,    3
  5,   4,    3
  0,   3,    5
  0,   3,    5
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = Bob
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Ann   (differs from STAR)
  RCV-IRV                = Ann   (differs from STAR)
  RCV-RR (Condorcet)     = Ann   (differs from STAR)
  Note: no ballots had tied scores, so RCV-IRV vs STAR here is a genuine
        method difference, not a tie-breaking artifact.
  Note: Ranked Robin (RCV-RR) sides with RCV-IRV, so STAR is the outlier
        here — STAR need not elect the Condorcet candidate.

[Runoff Reversal]
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Carl)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Bob)
  Candidate Carl earned the highest total score, but
  Candidate Bob won the automatic runoff — not a malfunction,
  STAR working as designed: the runoff elects the finalist preferred
  by the majority (of voters with a preference).

--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---

[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 5 ballots.
Count × Ann,Bob,Carl
    3 ×   5,  4,   3
    2 ×   0,  3,   5

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Carl          -- 19 -- First place
   Bob           -- 18 -- Second place
   Ann           -- 15
 Carl and Bob advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Bob           -- 3 -- First place
   Carl          -- 2
   Equal Support -- 0
 Bob wins.
   Runoff math:
     5  ballots cast
   − 0  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     5  voters with a preference  (majority = 3)
           Bob 3 (60%)  ·  Carl 2 (40%)

[STAR Voting: Winner — STAR Voting Method (single winner)]
 Bob
```

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Ann — STAR elected Bob instead (Ann was eliminated in the scoring round)

[Score Distribution] (how many ballots gave each star rating)
                Score
