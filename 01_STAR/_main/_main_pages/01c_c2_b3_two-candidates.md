# Equal support example ("I like both flavors")

*Generated from [`01c_c2_b3_two-candidates.yaml`](../01c_c2_b3_two-candidates.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Choco

## Scenario

Now we add a third ballot, from Julia, who likes both flavors equally (both 5 stars).
Because she scores the two finalists the same, her ballot counts as
"Equal Support = 1" in the Automatic Runoff Round.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Choco,Vanilla
    5,      3       # Caroline — Choco (5) over Vanilla (3)
    5,      0       # George - he likes only one flavor (Choco)
    5,      5       # Julia - she likes both flavors equally
```
