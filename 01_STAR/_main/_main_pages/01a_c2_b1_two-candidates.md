# The simplest possible STAR Voting example

*Generated from [`01a_c2_b1_two-candidates.yaml`](../01a_c2_b1_two-candidates.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Chocolate

## Scenario

The smallest possible STAR election: ONE voter, two flavors. Caroline scores
Chocolate 5 and Vanilla 3; with only two candidates both advance, and her
preference decides the runoff — Chocolate wins. Illustration-only: use it to
learn the report layout (ballots, Scoring Round, Automatic Runoff) before
anything interesting happens. With two candidates STAR always agrees with
Choose-One; the interesting cases start at three.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Chocolate,Vanilla
        5,      3       # Caroline — Chocolate (5) over Vanilla (3)
```
