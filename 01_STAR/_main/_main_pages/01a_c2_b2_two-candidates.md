# Same as before - but this time two ballots

*Generated from [`01a_c2_b2_two-candidates.yaml`](../01a_c2_b2_two-candidates.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Chocolate

## Scenario

The same election as 01a_c2_b1 with one more identical ballot: two voters,
both scoring Chocolate 5 and Vanilla 3. Nothing changes but the totals
(10 vs 6) — a first look at how the report scales counts. Compare the two
files line by line to see exactly which numbers one added ballot moves.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Chocolate,Vanilla
        5,      3       # Caroline — Chocolate (5) over Vanilla (3)
        5,      3       # Bob — same
```
