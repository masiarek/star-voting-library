# Three candidates, two ballots - single-winner STAR

*Generated from [`02b_c3_b2_three-candidates.yaml`](../02b_c3_b2_three-candidates.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Vanilla

## Scenario

Election: Pick your favorite ice cream flavor. Two voters (two ballots).
Same as before, but now we add a second ballot from David.

David:
- He likes Vanilla best (5 stars)
- He quite likes Almond (4 stars)
- He dislikes Choco (0 stars)

Watch the winner change. Choco flavor candidate is polarizing (Caroline 5, David 0), while
Vanilla has broad support (Caroline 3, David 5) - so Vanilla now wins. 
STAR rewards the broadly-liked compromise over a candidate that half the voters reject.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Choco,Vanilla,Almond
    5,      3,     0 # Caroline likes Choco (5) and Vanilla (3)
    0,      5,     4 # David likes Vanilla (5) best and Almond (4)
```
