# Vote splitting — two chocolates split the majority

*Generated from [`vote_splitting2.yaml`](../vote_splitting2.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** DarkChoco

## Scenario

Election: pick ONE dessert for the party. 360 voters.

220 of the 360 are chocolate lovers — a clear 61% majority. But there are TWO
chocolates on the menu, DarkChoco and MilkChoco, and 140 voters prefer Vanilla.

Under Choose-One Plurality each voter may name only one flavor, so the
chocolate majority splits its vote — 120 for DarkChoco, 100 for MilkChoco —
and Vanilla wins with just 140 of 360 (38.9%), a dessert a 61% majority
actively dislikes. That is vote splitting / the spoiler effect.

STAR fixes it without asking chocolate to drop a flavor: every voter scores
all three 0–5, so a chocolate lover can give BOTH chocolates a high score
instead of choosing between them. The two highest totals advance to an
automatic runoff, and the winner has majority support head-to-head.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Count:DarkChoco,MilkChoco,Vanilla
120:5,4,0   # love dark, like milk, no vanilla
100:4,5,0   # love milk, like dark, no vanilla
140:2,1,5   # love vanilla, mild on chocolate
```

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: DarkChoco — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = DarkChoco
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Vanilla   (differs from STAR)

[Vote-splitting check]
  Choose-One first choices: Vanilla 140, DarkChoco 120, MilkChoco 100
  Plurality winner: Vanilla (140, 38.9%)
  Bloc 'Chocolate' = DarkChoco, MilkChoco: combined 220 (61.1%); winner Vanilla is OUTSIDE it.
  => VOTE SPLITTING: the 'Chocolate' bloc is an outright majority (220 vs
     Vanilla's 140) but split across 2 candidates, so Vanilla won Choose-
     One. STAR elected DarkChoco.
