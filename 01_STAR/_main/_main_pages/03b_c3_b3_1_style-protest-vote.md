# Voting styles — low-score ballots

*Generated from [`03b_c3_b3_1_style-protest-vote.yaml`](../03b_c3_b3_1_style-protest-vote.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Almond

## Scenario

What if you dislike all the candidates? You can still vote: even low scores
register a relative preference, and STAR will count them. Here every voter
scores only 0s and 1s, yet a winner still emerges (Almond) from the 1s.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Choco,Almond,Vanilla
    0,     1,      0   # least-bad = Almond
    0,     0,      1   # least-bad = Vanilla
    0,     1,      0   # least-bad = Almond
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Almond
  Approval = Choco   (differs from STAR)

--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---

[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 3 ballots.
Count × Choco,Almond,Vanilla
    2 ×     0,     1,      0
    1 ×     0,     0,      1

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Almond        -- 2 -- First place
   Vanilla       -- 1 -- Second place
   Choco         -- 0
 Almond and Vanilla advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Almond        -- 2 -- First place
   Vanilla       -- 1
   Equal Support -- 0
 Almond wins.
   Runoff math:
     3  ballots cast
   − 0  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     3  voters with a preference  (majority = 2)
           Almond 2 (67%)  ·  Vanilla 1 (33%)

[STAR Voting: Winner — STAR Voting Method (single winner)]
