**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Don

## Scenario

A single-winner race that turns on the preference matrix (finalists only) and
the Condorcet line while hiding the score-distribution table — to show how the
`options:` block controls what gets printed.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Ann,Bob,Cal,Don
  3,  4,  2,  5  
  3,  4,  2,  5  
  3,  4,  2,  4  
  3,  5,  2,  3
```

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Don — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = Don
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Bob   (differs from STAR)
  RCV-IRV                = Bob   (differs from STAR)
  Approval               = Ann   (differs from STAR)
  Note: 2 of 4 ballots (50%) had equal non-zero scores, so their ranks were
        decided by candidate priority order. The RCV-IRV result may be an
        artifact of score-to-rank tie-breaking rather than a deep
        difference.
  Note: Ranked Robin (RCV-RR) agrees with STAR, so RCV-IRV is the lone
        outlier — the classic center-squeeze signature.

[Vote-splitting check]
  Choose-One first choices: Bob 2, Don 2, Ann 0, Cal 0
  Plurality winner: Bob (2, 50.0%)
  Bloc 'faction1' = Ann, Don: combined 2 (50.0%); winner Bob is OUTSIDE it.
  => No vote splitting: even combined (2), the 'faction1' bloc does not
     outpoll Bob (2).
  Bloc 'faction2' = Bob, Cal: combined 2 (50.0%); winner Bob is INSIDE it.
  => No vote splitting: the bloc's own front-runner (Bob) also wins Choose-
     One overall.

--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---
[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 4 ballots.
Count × Ann,Bob,Cal,Don
    2 ×   3,  4,  2,  5
    1 ×   3,  4,  2,  4
    1 ×   3,  5,  2,  3

[Score Distribution] (number of ballots giving each score)
     5  4  3  2  1  0  | Total   Avg
Ann  0  0  4  0  0  0  |    12   3.0
Bob  1  3  0  0  0  0  |    17   4.2
Cal  0  0  0  4  0  0  |     8   2.0
Don  2  1  1  0  0  0  |    17   4.2

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Bob           -- 17 -- First place
   Don           -- 17 -- Second place
   Ann           -- 12
   Cal           --  8
 Bob and Don advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Don           -- 2 -- First place
   Bob           -- 1
   Equal Support -- 1
 Don wins.
   Runoff math:
     4  ballots cast
   − 1  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     3  voters with a preference  (majority = 2)
           Don 2 (67%)  ·  Bob 1 (33%)
