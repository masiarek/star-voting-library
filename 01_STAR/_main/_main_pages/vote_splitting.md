# Vote splitting — two chocolates split the majority

*Generated from [`vote_splitting.yaml`](../vote_splitting.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** DarkChoco

## Scenario

Election: pick ONE dessert for the party. 36 voters.

Twenty-two of the thirty-six are chocolate lovers — a clear 61% majority. But
there are TWO chocolates on the menu, DarkChoco and MilkChoco, and only
fourteen voters prefer Vanilla.

Under Choose-One Plurality each voter may name only one flavor, so the
chocolate majority splits its vote — 12 for DarkChoco, 10 for MilkChoco — and
Vanilla wins with just 14 of 36 (38.9%), a dessert a 61% majority actively
dislikes. That is vote splitting / the spoiler effect.

STAR fixes it without asking chocolate to drop a flavor: every voter scores
all three 0–5, so a chocolate lover can give BOTH chocolates a high score
instead of choosing between them. The two highest totals advance to an
automatic runoff, and the winner has majority support head-to-head.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Count:DarkChoco,MilkChoco,Vanilla
12:5,4,0   # love dark, like milk, no vanilla
10:4,5,0   # love milk, like dark, no vanilla
14:2,1,5   # love vanilla, mild on chocolate
```
