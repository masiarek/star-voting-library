# Equal Support — counted in both rounds, neutral only in the tie-break

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** A

## Scenario

A demo for the "discounted votes" objection. 100 voters, candidates A, B, C.

40 voters score A=5 AND B=5 (they love both) and C=0. 35 prefer A (A=5, B=3).
25 prefer C (A=0, B=0, C=5).

Scoring Round: A and B have the highest totals and advance — and the 40
"equal support" ballots are exactly what pushed them there. So those ballots
were COUNTED: they chose the finalists.

Automatic Runoff: between A and B, the 40 equal-A-B ballots and the 25 C-lovers
(who scored both finalists 0) have no preference, so they are "Equal Support."
The runoff is decided by the 35 voters who did prefer one finalist: A wins.

Takeaway: an Equal Support ballot is a voter who DECLARED A TIE between the
finalists, not a voter who lost their voice. It counted in the scoring round
and is simply neutral in a tie-break it has no preference in.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Count:A,B,C
40:5,5,0   # love BOTH A and B -> helps advance them; neutral in the runoff
35:5,3,0   # prefer A over B -> decides the runoff
25:0,0,5   # prefer C -> no preference between A and B
```

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   A             -- 375 -- First place
   B             -- 305 -- Second place
   C             -- 125
 A and B advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   A             -- 35 -- First place
   B             --  0
   Equal Support -- 65
 A wins.
