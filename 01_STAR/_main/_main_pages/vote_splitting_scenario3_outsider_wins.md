# Vote splitting — scenario 3 of 3 — no spoiler (the outsider truly wins)

*Generated from [`vote_splitting_scenario3_outsider_wins.yaml`](../vote_splitting_scenario3_outsider_wins.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Vanilla

## Scenario

When the outsider is the genuine favorite, there is no spoiler — uniting the
bloc would not change the result.

62 voters. Vanilla 40, DarkChoco 12, MilkChoco 10. Chocolate combined is only
22, far short of Vanilla's 40.

Choose-One first choices: Vanilla 40, DarkChoco 12, MilkChoco 10. Vanilla wins —
and would still win even if the two chocolates merged into one (22 < 40). STAR
also elects Vanilla. Fair and square.

The [Vote-splitting check] reports: even combined, the bloc does not out-poll
the winner, so no spoiler occurred.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Count:DarkChoco,MilkChoco,Vanilla
12:5,4,0   # love dark, like milk, no vanilla
10:4,5,0   # love milk, like dark, no vanilla
40:1,0,5   # love vanilla, mild on chocolate
```
