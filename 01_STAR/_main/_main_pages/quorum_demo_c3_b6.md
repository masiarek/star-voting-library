# Quorum — an abstention still counts toward turnout

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Anna

## Scenario

A 10-member board (eligible_voters: 10). Six members submit a ballot — five
score the candidates, and one turns in a BLANK ballot (an abstention). No
explicit quorum is set, so the engine's default applies: a majority (>50%) of
eligible voters must participate — i.e. at least 6 of 10.

The teaching point (ties quorum to abstention): the blank ballot is the SIXTH
participant. A cast abstention is still participation, so it counts toward
quorum — and here it is exactly what carries turnout from 5 (not enough) to 6
(quorum met). Drop the abstention and quorum would FAIL. The abstainer changed
no candidate's score, but their presence made the election valid.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

Markers on these ballots: `-` blank · `~` race abstention · `&` candidate abstention · `?` spoiled · `%` spoiled+reissued — all tabulate as 0 (reported honestly).

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Anna          -- 15 -- First place
   Ben           -- 10 -- Second place
   Cara          --  1
 Anna and Ben advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Anna          -- 3 -- First place
   Ben           -- 2
   Equal Support -- 1
 Anna wins.
   Runoff math:
     6  ballots cast
   − 1  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     5  voters with a preference  (majority = 3)
           Anna 3 (60%)  ·  Ben 2 (40%)
