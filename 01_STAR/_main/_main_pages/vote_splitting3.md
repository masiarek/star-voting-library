# Vote splitting — two chocolates split the majority

*Generated from [`vote_splitting3.yaml`](../vote_splitting3.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** DarkChoco

## Scenario

Two chocolate flavors court the same majority while Vanilla consolidates the
rest — the classic vote-splitting shape. STAR shrugs it off: scores add up
per candidate, BOTH chocolates reach the runoff, and DarkChoco wins the
head-to-head 14-7. The blocs: entry makes the engine quantify the Chocolate
split explicitly ([Vote-Splitting Check]). For versions where splitting
actually flips a Choose-One winner, see method_comparisons/split_voting/.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Count:DarkChoco,MilkChoco,Vanilla
8:5,4,3   # love dark, like milk, vanilla is OK
7:4,5,0   # love milk, like dark, no vanilla
6:2,1,5   # love vanilla, mild on chocolate
```
