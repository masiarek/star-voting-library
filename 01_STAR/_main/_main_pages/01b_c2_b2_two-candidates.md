# Again, very similar - this time second ballot is 5 and 0

*Generated from [`01b_c2_b2_two-candidates.yaml`](../01b_c2_b2_two-candidates.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Choco

## Scenario

Same as before (Caroline vote is the first), 
but this time with one more person (hence one more ballot 
- the second row) — from George:

George (new ballot) he likes only Choco:
- he loves the Choco flavor (5 stars)
- he dislikes Vanilla (0 stars)

We are adding up the scores given to each candidate (Tallying = Scoring Round).

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Choco,Vanilla
    5,      3       # Caroline - she likes both flavors
    5,      0       # George - he likes only one flavor (Choco)
```
