# Vote splitting — scenario 1 of 3 — the spoiler strikes

*Generated from [`vote_splitting_scenario1_spoiler.yaml`](../vote_splitting_scenario1_spoiler.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** DarkChoco

## Scenario

A bloc that is a MAJORITY can still LOSE under Choose-One when it splits.

90 voters. 55 are chocolate lovers (a 61% majority), but they split across two
chocolates — 30 for DarkChoco, 25 for MilkChoco. The other 35 prefer Vanilla.

Choose-One first choices: Vanilla 35, DarkChoco 30, MilkChoco 25. Vanilla wins
with 38.9% even though 61% wanted chocolate — that is the spoiler effect.

STAR lets chocolate lovers score BOTH chocolates, so the bloc is not split and
DarkChoco wins. Watch the [Vote-splitting check] confirm it.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Count:DarkChoco,MilkChoco,Vanilla
30:5,4,0   # love dark, like milk, no vanilla
25:4,5,0   # love milk, like dark, no vanilla
35:2,1,5   # love vanilla, mild on chocolate
```

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: DarkChoco — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = DarkChoco
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Vanilla   (differs from STAR)

[Vote-splitting check]
  Choose-One first choices: Vanilla 35, DarkChoco 30, MilkChoco 25
  Plurality winner: Vanilla (35, 38.9%)
  Bloc 'Chocolate' = DarkChoco, MilkChoco: combined 55 (61.1%); winner Vanilla is OUTSIDE it.
  => VOTE SPLITTING: the 'Chocolate' bloc is an outright majority (55 vs
     Vanilla's 35) but split across 2 candidates, so Vanilla won Choose-One.
     STAR elected DarkChoco.
