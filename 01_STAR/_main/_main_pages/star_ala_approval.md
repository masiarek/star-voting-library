# STAR à la Approval — 0/1 & marker ballots are legal on a STAR ballot

*Generated from [`star_ala_approval.yaml`](../star_ala_approval.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** D

## Scenario

A STAR file (voting_method: STAR): it shows that approval-style 0/1
scoring and every ballot marker are LEGAL on a STAR ballot. Eight ballots
exercise the whole marker set — blanks (-), a race abstention (~), an
all-zero ballot, and a max-everything 5,5,5,5 — all tabulating as documented
(markers count 0 and are reported honestly). D wins. For real Approval
counting (most approvals wins), see 04_Approval/.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

Markers on these ballots: `-` blank · `~` race abstention · `&` candidate abstention · `?` spoiled · `%` spoiled+reissued — all tabulate as 0 (reported honestly).

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: D — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = D
  Choose-One (Plurality) = A   (differs from STAR)
  RCV-IRV                = A   (differs from STAR)
  Approval               = A   (differs from STAR)
  Note: 4 of 8 ballots (50%) had equal non-zero scores, so their ranks were
        decided by candidate priority order. The RCV-IRV result may be an
        artifact of score-to-rank tie-breaking rather than a deep
        difference.
  Note: Ranked Robin (RCV-RR) agrees with STAR, so RCV-IRV is the lone
        outlier — the classic center-squeeze signature.

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   D             -- 8 -- First place
   A             -- 7 -- Second place
   B             -- 6
   C             -- 6
 D and A advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   D             -- 1 -- First place
   A             -- 0
   Equal Support -- 7
 D wins.
   Runoff math:
     8  ballots cast
   − 7  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)

     1  voters with a preference  (majority = 1)
           D 1 (100%)  ·  A 0 (0%)
