# Abstentions — blank and abstaining ballots in STAR

*Generated from [`abstentions.yaml`](../abstentions.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Dog

## Scenario

Five CAST ballots, only three of which can decide the runoff: a 5-5 Equal
Support ballot and an all-zero ballot count as cast but express no preference
between the finalists. Teaches the runoff denominator: Dog beats Cat 2-1
among voters WITH a preference, and the two-line runoff summary
(show_runoff_percent) reconciles 5 cast = 3 decided + 2 Equal Support, so
the percentages never look like votes went missing.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

Markers on these ballots: `-` blank · `~` race abstention · `&` candidate abstention · `?` spoiled · `%` spoiled+reissued — all tabulate as 0 (reported honestly).

```text
Dog,Cat
5,0 # Dog  — a clear preference (decides the runoff)
4,0 # Dog  — a clear preference (decides the runoff)
0,5 # Cat  — a clear preference (decides the runoff)
5,5 # Equal Support — a CAST ballot that rates both finalists the same
0,0 # all-zero — a CAST ballot that supports neither (an explicit zero)
-,- # blank — a true ABSTENTION: no score recorded for anyone
```

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Dog           -- 14 -- First place
   Cat           -- 10 -- Second place
 Dog and Cat advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Dog           -- 2 -- First place
   Cat           -- 1
   Equal Support -- 3
 Dog wins.
   Runoff math:
     6  ballots cast
   − 3  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     3  voters with a preference  (majority = 2)
           Dog 2 (67%)  ·  Cat 1 (33%)
