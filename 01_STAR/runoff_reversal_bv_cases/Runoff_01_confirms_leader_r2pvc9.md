# Runoff 01 — Runoff confirms the leader (control)

**Level 101 · the baseline.** Before showing a reversal, show the ordinary case: the Scoring-Round leader is *also* the candidate more voters prefer, so the Automatic Runoff **confirms** the leader. This proves the runoff isn't rigged against whoever has the most stars — it only *checks* them. (Winner is also the Condorcet winner.)

Two views of the **same election** (BV id [`r2pvc9`](https://bettervoting.com/r2pvc9/results)): BetterVoting's display and the LH engine's text report. Same ballots, same result.

## View 1 — BetterVoting

Aspen leads the Scoring Round (12) and wins the Automatic Runoff 2–1; the dashed line is the majority threshold (½ of the voters with a preference), which Aspen clears. Source: <https://bettervoting.com/r2pvc9/results>.

**Result — Scoring Round + Automatic Runoff (raw votes):**

```

> **BV ↔ LH wording.** The line `Aspen 2 (67%) vs Birch 1 (33%)` is BetterVoting's *Runoff Votes* (2 / 1) and *% Between Finalists* (67% / 33%) folded into one line — LH names its denominator (`Voters with a preference`) instead of using table columns. [Why the words differ →](../../00_start_here/STAR_reporting/reporting_diff_BV_LH.md#same-numbers-different-words)

## The point

Aspen leads on stars **and** is preferred head-to-head (2 of 3 voters score Aspen above Birch), so the runoff confirms Aspen. The runoff didn't change the answer — but it *asked the question*, and that's the safeguard. A reversal only happens when raw stars and majority preference point at **different** candidates (next: [the atom — the smallest reversal →](../runoff_overturns_leader/teaching_runoff_reversal.md)). The two reports agree exactly — BetterVoting and the LH engine are two views of one count.
