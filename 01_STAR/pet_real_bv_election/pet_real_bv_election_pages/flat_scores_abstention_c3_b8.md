## Scenario

A REAL BetterVoting election (BV id dq2dmm), captured 2026-06-28. The canonical
small case for how BetterVoting and the LH engine differ on "no preference"
ballots — richer than two candidates because a third candidate (Cherry)
separates three distinct ideas a single election usually blurs:

  • a TRUE abstention (a blank ballot — no score for anyone): 1
  • a FLAT ballot (every candidate scored the same) — what BetterVoting files
    as an "abstention": 3   (the blank, 0,0,0, AND 3,3,3)
  • EQUAL SUPPORT in the runoff (the two finalists tied): 4
    (those 3 flat ballots PLUS 5,5,0, which is tied on Apple/Banana but is NOT
    flat, so BetterVoting counts it normally)

The point: BetterVoting's "flat = abstention" rule and STAR's "Equal Support"
are different sets. 3,3,3 is a fully engaged vote (Cherry got 3 too) that BV
drops; 5,5,0 is Equal Support that BV keeps. BetterVoting reports
nAbstentions = 3, nTallyVotes = 5; the LH engine counts all 8 and marks only
the blank an abstention. Same winner (Banana). Frozen export:

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

Markers on these ballots: `-` blank · `~` race abstention · `&` candidate abstention · `?` spoiled · `%` spoiled+reissued — all tabulate as 0 (reported honestly).

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Banana        -- 27 -- First place
   Apple         -- 20 -- Second place
   Cherry        --  7
 Banana and Apple advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Banana        -- 3 -- First place
   Apple         -- 1
   Equal Support -- 4
 Banana wins.
   Runoff math:
     8  ballots cast
   − 4  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     4  voters with a preference  (majority = 3)
           Banana 3 (75%)  ·  Apple 1 (25%)
