## Scenario

A REAL BetterVoting election (BV id 3w6v4b), captured 2026-06-28, run as the
smallest case that proves how BetterVoting and the LH engine differ on a
"no-preference" ballot. Frozen raw export:
small_abstention_c2_b5_bv_export.json. Full write-up:
small_case_abstention_lesson.md.
How to read this report (LH): 00_start_here/STAR_reporting/reporting_LH/

Five ballots, two candidates:

  A,B
  0,5   prefers B
  4,0   prefers A
  5,5   Equal Support — loves BOTH equally (a cast vote, NOT an abstention)
  5,0   prefers A
  -,-   blank — the one true abstention

BetterVoting reports: nAbstentions = 2, nTallyVotes = 3 — i.e. it files the
5,5 ballot AND the blank under "abstention." The LH engine counts all 5 cast
ballots, treats only the blank as an abstention, and puts the 5,5 in Equal
Support (counted in the score round, neutral in the runoff). Same winner (A);
the single-ballot difference is the 5,5.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

Markers on these ballots: `-` blank · `~` race abstention · `&` candidate abstention · `?` spoiled · `%` spoiled+reissued — all tabulate as 0 (reported honestly).

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---

[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 5 ballots. Note: 1 of 5 ballots is marked as an abstention.
A,B
0,5
4,0
5,5
5,0
-,-
  ('-' = left blank / abstained; '0' = scored zero — both count as 0 stars.)

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   A             -- 14 -- First place
   B             -- 10 -- Second place
 A and B advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   A             -- 2 -- First place
   B             -- 1
   Equal Support -- 2
 A wins.
   Runoff math:
     5  ballots cast
   − 2  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     3  voters with a preference  (majority = 2)
           A 2 (67%)  ·  B 1 (33%)
