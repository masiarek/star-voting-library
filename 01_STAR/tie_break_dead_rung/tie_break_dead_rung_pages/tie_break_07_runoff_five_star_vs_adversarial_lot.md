# Dead rung 03 — runoff tie broken by five-star

*Generated from [`tie_break_07_runoff_five_star_vs_adversarial_lot.yaml`](../tie_break_07_runoff_five_star_vs_adversarial_lot.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Ann

**Official tie-break (lot) order:** Ben > Ann — consulted only if every deterministic tiebreaker stays tied ([how the ladder works](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md)).

## Scenario

Two candidates, two voters, a perfect standoff: tied head-to-head (1-1) and
tied on total score (5-5). The runoff ladder's five-star rung decides —
Ann has one 5, Ben none, so Ann wins. The lot order deliberately favors
Ben: the expected winner (Ann) proves five-star outranks the lot.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Ann,Ben
5,1   # Ann enthusiast
0,4   # Ben supporter, tops out at 4
```

[Condorcet Winner]
  No strict Condorcet winner; unbeaten candidates: Ann, Ben (pairwise ties)

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = Ann
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Ben   (differs from STAR)
  RCV-IRV                = Ben   (differs from STAR)
  Approval               = Ben   (differs from STAR)
  RCV-RR                 = Ben   (differs from STAR)
  Note: no ballots had tied scores, so RCV-IRV vs STAR here is a genuine
        method difference, not a tie-breaking artifact.
  Note: Ranked Robin (RCV-RR) sides with RCV-IRV, so STAR is the outlier
        here — STAR need not elect the Condorcet candidate.
