# Tie-break 01 — scoring-round tie, FIVE-STAR breaks it (a 5 exists)

*Generated from [`tie_break_01_scoring_five_star_breaks.yaml`](../tie_break_01_scoring_five_star_breaks.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Alice

## Scenario

A scoring-round tie for the second finalist slot that the five-star rung DOES
resolve, because a max-score (5) vote exists. Alice leads (10); Ben and Cara
tie at 6 and are also tied head-to-head (pairwise 1-1), so the tie falls to the
second rung — most score-5 votes. Ben has one 5, Cara has none, so Ben advances.
Contrast with tie_break_02 (same shape, capped so no 5 exists -> the lot decides).
See 00_start_here/STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md ("dead rung").

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Alice,Ben,Cara
5,5,3
5,1,3
