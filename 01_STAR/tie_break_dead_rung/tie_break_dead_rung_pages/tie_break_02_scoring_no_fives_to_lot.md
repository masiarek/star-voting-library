# Tie-break 02 — scoring-round tie, NO fives, five-star is a dead rung → LOT

*Generated from [`tie_break_02_scoring_no_fives_to_lot.yaml`](../tie_break_02_scoring_no_fives_to_lot.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Alice

**Official tie-break (lot) order:** Alice > Ben > Cara — consulted only if every deterministic tiebreaker stays tied ([how the ladder works](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md)).

## Scenario

The same tie structure as tie_break_01, but every score is capped at 4, so NO
candidate has a single max-score (5) vote. Alice leads (8); Ben and Cara tie at
4 and are tied head-to-head (pairwise 1-1). The five-star rung still runs, but
reads 0-0 — it cannot separate them — so the tie falls through to the LOT.
lot_numbers pins the order, so Ben advances by lot priority (not by five-star).
The eventual winner is still Alice; what changed is WHICH rung chose the second
finalist. See 00_start_here/STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Alice,Ben,Cara
4,4,2
4,0,2
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---

[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 2 ballots.
Alice,Ben,Cara
    4,  4,   2
    4,  0,   2

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Alice         -- 8 -- First place
   Ben           -- 4 -- Tied for second place
   Cara          -- 4 -- Tied for second place
 Alice advances, but there's a two-way tie for second.

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round: First tiebreaker]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups advances.
   Ben           -- 1 -- Tied for second place
   Cara          -- 1 -- Tied for second place
   Equal Support -- 0
 There's still a two-way tie for second.

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round: Second tiebreaker]
 The candidate with the most votes of score 5 advances.
   Ben           -- 0 -- Tied for second place
   Cara          -- 0 -- Tied for second place
 There's still a two-way tie for second.

*(Ties are resolved by choosing the tied candidate with the highest-priority official lot number.)*
    Lot-number priority order: ['Alice', 'Ben', 'Cara']

[Tiebreaker: Lot Number Priority]
  Tie among: ['Ben', 'Cara']
  Resolved: ['Ben'] (selected by lot-number priority).

[Lot-decided tie — rare]
  ⚠ The ballots did not break this tie: the deterministic rungs
    (pairwise / score, then five-star) all came back equal, so the
    pre-published LOT order chose among the tied candidates — the
    result here was set by lot, not by the votes. Usually the
    "dead rung": no tied candidate held a score-5 vote (five-star
    counts fives, not fours). Verify the tied candidates' 5-counts.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Alice         -- 1 -- First place
   Ben           -- 0
   Equal Support -- 1
 Alice wins.
   Runoff math:
     2  ballots cast
   − 1  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     1  voters with a preference  (majority = 1)
           Alice 1 (100%)  ·  Ben 0 (0%)

[STAR Voting: Winner — STAR Voting Method (single winner)]
 Alice
