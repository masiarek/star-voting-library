# Tie-break 03 — runoff tie, score tied, NO fives → LOT

*Generated from [`tie_break_03_runoff_no_fives_to_lot.yaml`](../tie_break_03_runoff_no_fives_to_lot.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Alice

**Official tie-break (lot) order:** Alice > Ben — consulted only if every deterministic tiebreaker stays tied ([how the ladder works](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md)).

## Scenario

The runoff ladder's dead-rung case. Two candidates, both finalists. They tie
head-to-head (1-1) AND tie on total score (4-4), so the runoff falls to its
second rung — most score-5 votes. But neither earned a 5, so five-star reads
0-0 and the LOT decides. lot_numbers pins Alice ahead of Ben, so Alice wins.
Contrast tie_break_04 (same tie, but a 5 exists -> five-star decides).
See 00_start_here/STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

Alice,Ben

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Alice         -- 4 -- First place
   Ben           -- 4 -- Second place
 Alice and Ben advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Alice         -- 1 -- Tied for first place
   Ben           -- 1 -- Tied for first place
   Equal Support -- 0
 There's a two-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round: First tiebreaker]
 The highest-scoring candidate wins.
   Alice         -- 4 -- Tied for first place
   Ben           -- 4 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a two-way tie for first.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round: Second tiebreaker]
 The candidate with the most votes of score 5 wins.
   Alice         -- 0 -- Tied for first place
   Ben           -- 0 -- Tied for first place
 There's still a two-way tie for first.

*(Ties are resolved by choosing the tied candidate with the highest-priority official lot number.)*
    Lot-number priority order: ['Alice', 'Ben']

[Tiebreaker: Lot Number Priority]
  Tie among: ['Alice', 'Ben']
  Resolved: ['Alice'] (selected by lot-number priority).
