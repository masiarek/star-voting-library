# 01_STAR — single-winner STAR Voting

The library's headline method: **STAR** (Score Then Automatic Runoff) for one
seat. Score every candidate 0–5; the two highest-scoring candidates go to an
automatic runoff decided by which of the two each ballot prefers.

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| [`_main/`](_main/README_main.md) | the teaching progression — two-candidate intros, ballot styles, abstentions, quorum, vote-splitting scenarios, display options |
| [`runoff_overturns_leader/`](runoff_overturns_leader/README_runoff_overturns_leader.md) | the Runoff Reversal set — real BetterVoting elections where the runoff confirms or overturns the score leader |
| [`Flat_scores_ties/`](Flat_scores_ties/README_Flat_scores_ties.md) | ties and flat-score edge cases, and how the tiebreakers resolve them |
| [`pet_real_bv_election/`](pet_real_bv_election/README_pet_real_bv_election.md) | a real 461-ballot BetterVoting race, imported and reconciled line by line |
