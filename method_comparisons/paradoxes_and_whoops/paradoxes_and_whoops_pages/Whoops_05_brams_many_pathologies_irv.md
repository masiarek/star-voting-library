# Whoops 05 — many IRV pathologies in one election (Brams)

*Generated from [`Whoops_05_brams_many_pathologies_irv.yaml`](../Whoops_05_brams_many_pathologies_irv.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [RCV-IRV (Instant Runoff)](../../../00_start_here/RCV_IRV) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** B

## Scenario

Steven Brams' example (Notices of the AMS, 1982; via rangevoting.org). IRV elects B,
but G is the Condorcet winner (beats B 14-7, beats everyone). The same election shows
a no-show paradox, a truncation incentive, favorite-betrayal, and non-monotonicity —
several IRV pathologies at once. Sincere, academically sourced, ranked ballots.
Approval/STAR/Condorcet/Ranked Robin would elect G. Level 301.

## Ballots

Each row is one voter's ranking, most-preferred first (`N:` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
7:B>G>N>F
6:G>B>N>F
5:N>G>B>F
3:F>N>G>B
```
