# STAR misses the Condorcet winner — STAR's own signature failure (BV2156)

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Ada

## Scenario

STAR is not perfect, and this is its signature failure. Cleo is the CONDORCET WINNER
(beats Ada 60-40 and Bruno 65-35 head-to-head) but is a low-scored compromise: the two
wings score Cleo only a 2, so Cleo finishes THIRD on score and never reaches the runoff.
STAR elects ADA. Sincere ballots, no strategy. This is the score-method cousin of IRV's
center squeeze: the broadly-acceptable middle is excluded before the final comparison.
Rare (STAR is ~98% Condorcet-efficient in spatial models) but structural. Level 301.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Ada, Bruno, Cleo
40 × 5, 1, 2      # Ada > Cleo > Bruno
35 × 1, 5, 2      # Bruno > Cleo > Ada
25 × 3, 3, 5      # Cleo > (Ada = Bruno)
```

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Cleo — STAR elected Ada instead (Cleo was eliminated in the scoring round)

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR               = Ada
  RCV-RR (Condorcet) = Cleo   (differs from STAR)

   Cleo          -- 275
 Ada and Bruno advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.

   Bruno         -- 35
   Equal Support -- 25
 Ada wins.
