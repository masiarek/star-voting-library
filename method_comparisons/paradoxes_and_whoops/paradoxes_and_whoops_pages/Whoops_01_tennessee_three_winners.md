# Whoops 01 — same ballots, three methods, three winners (Tennessee)

*Generated from [`Whoops_01_tennessee_three_winners.yaml`](../Whoops_01_tennessee_three_winners.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Nashville

## Scenario

The classic Tennessee state-capital example. One set of ballots; Plurality picks
MEMPHIS, RCV-IRV picks KNOXVILLE, and Condorcet + STAR pick NASHVILLE (the central
compromise that beats everyone head-to-head). Nobody is being strategic — these are
sincere ballots. The whoops belongs to Plurality and IRV here. Scores are a simple
geographic-distance spatial model. Level 201. Fairness note in the lesson.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, Knoxville
42 × 5, 2, 1, 0      # Memphis voters (far west)
26 × 1, 5, 3, 2      # Nashville voters (central)
15 × 0, 3, 5, 4      # Chattanooga voters (southeast)
17 × 0, 3, 4, 5      # Knoxville voters (east)
```

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Nashville — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = Nashville
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Memphis   (differs from STAR)
  RCV-IRV                = Knoxville   (differs from STAR)
  Note: no ballots had tied scores, so RCV-IRV vs STAR here is a genuine
        method difference, not a tie-breaking artifact.
  Note: Ranked Robin (RCV-RR) agrees with STAR, so RCV-IRV is the lone
        outlier — the classic center-squeeze signature.
