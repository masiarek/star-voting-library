**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Cal

## Scenario

Election 2 of 4 from "The Black Curtain". Same five voters, same first
choices — but now BOTH blocs love Ann and Cal (scores 8 and 9) and everyone
hates Bob. Choose-One, RCV-IRV, STAR, and pure Score all elect Cal.
Approval ("approve" = video score 5+) ends in a 5–5 coin toss between Ann
and Cal — at approval resolution the two near-clones are indistinguishable.
Original 0–9 video scores mapped to 0–5: 0→0, 1→1, 4→2, 5→3, 8→4, 9→5.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Ann,Bob,Cal
4,0,5   # voter 1 — video 0-9: A=8 B=0 C=9
4,0,5   # voter 2 — video 0-9: A=8 B=0 C=9
4,0,5   # voter 3 — video 0-9: A=8 B=0 C=9
5,0,4   # voter 4 — video 0-9: A=9 B=0 C=8
5,0,4   # voter 5 — video 0-9: A=9 B=0 C=8
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Cal
  Approval = Ann   (differs from STAR)

--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---

[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 5 ballots.
Count × Ann,Bob,Cal
    3 ×   4,  0,  5
    2 ×   5,  0,  4

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Cal           -- 23 -- First place
   Ann           -- 22 -- Second place
   Bob           --  0
 Cal and Ann advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Cal           -- 3 -- First place
   Ann           -- 2
   Equal Support -- 0
 Cal wins.
   Runoff math:
     5  ballots cast
   − 0  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     5  voters with a preference  (majority = 3)
           Cal 3 (60%)  ·  Ann 2 (40%)

[STAR Voting: Winner — STAR Voting Method (single winner)]
 Cal
```
