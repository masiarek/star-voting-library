# The Black Curtain

*Generated from [`Black_Curtain_01a_c3_b5_approval.yaml`](../Black_Curtain_01a_c3_b5_approval.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [Approval Voting](../../../../00_start_here/Approval_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Bob

## Scenario

The SAME five voters as Black_Curtain_01_c3_b5_hidden-consensus.yaml, counted as
an Approval election. In the video, "approve" = any 0–9 score of 5 or more
(on this repo's 0–5 scale: 3 or more). Bob — every voter's strong second —
is approved by all 5 voters and wins; Cal (the Choose-One / RCV-IRV / STAR
winner) gets only 3 approvals. Same ballots, different question, different
winner. See README_black_curtain.md.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's approvals (`1` = approve, `0`/blank = not approved).

```text
Ann,Bob,Cal
0,1,1   # voter 1 — approves Bob (8) and Cal (9)
0,1,1   # voter 2 — approves Bob (8) and Cal (9)
0,1,1   # voter 3 — approves Bob (8) and Cal (9)
1,1,0   # voter 4 — approves Ann (9) and Bob (8)
1,1,0   # voter 5 — approves Ann (9) and Bob (8)
```

## What the engine says

Full report from the [`_tabulated` mirror](../cases_tabulated/Black_Curtain_01a_c3_b5_approval_tabulated.txt) (regenerated on every run; every analysis forced on):

```text
--- Approval Voting (single winner) ---
 Tabulating 5 ballots (any non-zero score = approval).

Ballots:
   columns = Ann, Bob, Cal      (1 = approve; 0 / blank / marker = not approved)
     3 × 0,1,1
     2 × 1,1,0

   Bob -- 5 (100%) -- Elected
   Cal -- 3 (60%)
   Ann -- 2 (40%)

[Approval Distribution] (how many candidates each ballot approved)
   10 approvals across 5 ballots — average 2.0 of 3 (range 2–2).
     approved 2: 5 ballots

[Co-Approval Matrix]
 Of the voters who approved the ROW candidate, the % who ALSO approved the COLUMN candidate.
        |  Bob   |  Cal   |  Ann   |
   ---------------------------------
   Bob  |   --   |  60%   |  40%   |
   Cal  |  100%  |   --   |   0%   |
   Ann  |  100%  |   0%   |   --   |

Winner — Approval Voting (single winner)
  Bob
