**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Cal

## Scenario

Election 3 of 4 from "The Black Curtain". Same five voters, same first
choices as before — but now the MINORITY bloc's favorite Ann is everyone's
strong pick (8 or 9 from all five voters), while 3-voter favorite Cal is
hated by the other bloc. Choose-One, RCV-IRV, and STAR still elect Cal
(runoff 3 to 2); Approval and pure Score elect Ann (approved 5×, avg 8.4).
Original 0–9 video scores mapped to 0–5: 0→0, 1→1, 4→2, 5→3, 8→4, 9→5.

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Cal — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Cal
  Approval = Ann   (differs from STAR)

Majority Preference Enforcement Principle:
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Ann)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Cal)
  Candidate Ann earned the highest total score,
  but Candidate Cal won the automatic runoff by being the head-to-head majority favorite.
