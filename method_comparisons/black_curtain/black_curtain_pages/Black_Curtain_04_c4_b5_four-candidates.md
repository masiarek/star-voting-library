**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Cal

## Scenario

Election 4 of 4 from "The Black Curtain". Four candidates now, but behind
the curtain (first choices only) it looks identical to the other three:
Cal 3, Ann 2. Choose-One, RCV-IRV, and STAR elect Cal. Approval ("approve"
= video score 5+) is a 3–3 coin toss between Cal and Dee. Pure Score on the
video's 0–9 ballots elects Bob by a hair (avg 5.6 vs Cal's 5.4) — a margin
too fine to survive the 0–5 rescale (totals here: Cal 15, Bob 14). Scale
granularity is part of the lesson; see README_black_curtain.md.

Original 0–9 video scores mapped to 0–5: 0→0, 1→1, 4→2, 5→3, 8→4, 9→5.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Ann,Bob,Cal,Dee
0,2,5,3   # voter 1 — video 0-9: A=0 B=4 C=9 D=5
0,2,5,3   # voter 2 — video 0-9: A=0 B=4 C=9 D=5
0,2,5,3   # voter 3 — video 0-9: A=0 B=4 C=9 D=5
5,4,0,1   # voter 4 — video 0-9: A=9 B=8 C=0 D=1
