# The Black Curtain

*Generated from [`Black_Curtain_01_c3_b5_hidden-consensus.yaml`](../Black_Curtain_01_c3_b5_hidden-consensus.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Cal

## Scenario

Election 1 of 4 from "The Black Curtain" (Common Sense for Uniting America /
MaxVoting.org). A 3-voter bloc loves Cal and hates Ann; a 2-voter bloc loves
Ann and hates Cal. EVERY voter gave Bob a near-top score — the broad
consensus candidate.

Choose-One, RCV-IRV, and STAR all elect Cal (the majority bloc's favorite;
STAR's runoff prefers Cal over Bob 3 to 2). Approval and pure Score would
elect Bob. No method is "wrong" — they answer different questions.
Original 0–9 video scores mapped to 0–5: 0→0, 1→1, 4→2, 5→3, 8→4, 9→5.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Ann,Bob,Cal
0,4,5   # voter 1 — video 0-9: A=0 B=8 C=9
0,4,5   # voter 2 — video 0-9: A=0 B=8 C=9
0,4,5   # voter 3 — video 0-9: A=0 B=8 C=9
5,4,0   # voter 4 — video 0-9: A=9 B=8 C=0
5,4,0   # voter 5 — video 0-9: A=9 B=8 C=0
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Cal
  Approval = Bob   (differs from STAR)

[Runoff Reversal]
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Bob)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Cal)
  Candidate Bob earned the highest total score, but
  Candidate Cal won the automatic runoff — not a malfunction,
  STAR working as designed: the runoff elects the finalist preferred
  by the majority (of voters with a preference).

--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---

[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 5 ballots.
Count × Ann,Bob,Cal
    3 ×   0,  4,  5
    2 ×   5,  4,  0

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Bob           -- 20 -- First place
   Cal           -- 15 -- Second place
   Ann           -- 10
 Bob and Cal advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Cal           -- 3 -- First place
   Bob           -- 2
   Equal Support -- 0
 Cal wins.
   Runoff math:
     5  ballots cast
   − 0  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     5  voters with a preference  (majority = 3)
           Cal 3 (60%)  ·  Bob 2 (40%)

[STAR Voting: Winner — STAR Voting Method (single winner)]
 Cal
