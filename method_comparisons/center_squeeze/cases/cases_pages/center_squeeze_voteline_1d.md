# Center squeeze — the voteline 1D spectrum (Red / Green / Yellow)

*Generated from [`center_squeeze_voteline_1d.yaml`](../center_squeeze_voteline_1d.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Green

## Scenario

The classic 1-D spectrum demo (zesty.ca/voting/voteline): Red on the left,
Green in the center, Yellow on the right, with voters spread across the line.
Green is the CONDORCET winner (beats Red AND Yellow head-to-head) but has the
FEWEST first choices (31.3%), so RCV-IRV eliminates Green first and YELLOW wins
(52.9%) — the center squeeze. STAR advances Green on strength of support and wins
the runoff 65-35. Plurality also picks Yellow. Approval / Borda / Condorcet /
Ranked Robin all pick Green. Scores are a reasonable 1-D spatial model (own side
5, adjacent center 3, far side 0-1). Weights are percentages x10. Level 201/301.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Red, Green, Yellow
332 × 5, 3, 0      # red > green > yellow  (left bloc)
138 × 3, 5, 1      # green > red > yellow  (center-left)
175 × 1, 5, 3      # green > yellow > red  (center-right)
353 × 0, 3, 5      # yellow > green > red  (right bloc)
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = Green
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Yellow   (differs from STAR)
  RCV-IRV                = Yellow   (differs from STAR)
  Note: no ballots had tied scores, so RCV-IRV vs STAR here is a genuine
        method difference, not a tie-breaking artifact.
  Note: Ranked Robin (RCV-RR) agrees with STAR, so RCV-IRV is the lone
        outlier — the classic center-squeeze signature.

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Green         -- 3620 -- First place
   Yellow        -- 2428 -- Second place
   Red           -- 2249
 Green and Yellow advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Green         -- 645 -- First place
   Yellow        -- 353
   Equal Support --   0
 Green wins.
   Runoff math:
