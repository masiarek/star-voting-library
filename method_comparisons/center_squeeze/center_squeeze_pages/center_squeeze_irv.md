# Center squeeze (RCV-IRV) — minimal 27-voter case (the moderate is eliminated)

*Generated from [`center_squeeze_irv.yaml`](../center_squeeze_irv.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [RCV-IRV (Instant Runoff)](../../../00_start_here/RCV_IRV) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Left

## Scenario

The minimal center-squeeze electorate, counted by RCV-IRV: 27 voters on a
1-D spectrum. Center is every faction's acceptable second choice and beats
either pole head-to-head — but holds the FEWEST first choices (6), is
eliminated in round one, and polar Left wins. The matched file
center_squeeze_star.yaml scores the same profile 0-5 and elects Center.
See center_squeeze_voteline_1d.yaml for the spectrum picture and the
center-squeeze topic hub for the cross-method view.

## Ballots

Each row is one voter's ranking, most-preferred first (`N:` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
12:Left>Center>Right
9:Right>Center>Left
6:Center>Left>Right
```
