# BV parity — Plurality (choose-one): most first-marks wins

*Generated from [`BV_Library_plurality_single_winner.yaml`](../BV_Library_plurality_single_winner.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [plurality](../../../00_start_here) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Dave

## Scenario

Ported from BetterVoting's tabulator unit tests (Plurality.test.ts :: "Single Winner Test").
Choose-one ballots (a single 1 per voter); Dave has the most and wins. The original
had three spoiled/invalid ballots — one abstention, two out-of-bounds marks, and one
overvote — which BetterVoting counts as zero support; here the abstention is written
as blanks and the invalid rows as all-zero so the file validates while preserving the
winner. This engine tabulates choose-one 0/1 ballots via its STAR path, which for
single-mark ballots is equivalent to a plurality count.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

Markers on these ballots: `-` blank · `~` race abstention · `&` candidate abstention · `?` spoiled · `%` spoiled+reissued — all tabulate as 0 (reported honestly).

--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---
[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 14 ballots. Note: 1 of 14 ballots is marked as an abstention.
Count × Alice,Bob,Carol,Dave

    1 ×     -,  -,    -,   -
  ('-' = left blank / abstained; '0' = scored zero — both count as 0 stars.)

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Dave          -- 5 -- First place
   Carol         -- 3 -- Second place
   Bob           -- 2
   Alice         -- 0
 Dave and Carol advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Dave          -- 5 -- First place
   Carol         -- 3
   Equal Support -- 6
 Dave wins.
   Runoff math:
     14  ballots cast
   −  6  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ──
      8  voters with a preference  (majority = 5)
           Dave 5 (62%)  ·  Carol 3 (38%)
