# BV parity — STAR: runoff, lower total wins the runoff

*Generated from [`BV_Library_star_runoff.yaml`](../BV_Library_star_runoff.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Bill

## Scenario

Ported from BetterVoting's tabulator unit tests (Star.test.ts :: "Runoff").
Bill wins the automatic runoff despite a simple two-ballot field.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Allison,Bill
0,5
2,4
