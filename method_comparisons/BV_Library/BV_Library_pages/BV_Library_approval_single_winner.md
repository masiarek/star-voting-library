# BV parity — Approval: most approvals wins (single winner)

*Generated from [`BV_Library_approval_single_winner.yaml`](../BV_Library_approval_single_winner.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [Approval Voting](../../../00_start_here/Approval_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Dave

## Scenario

Ported from BetterVoting's tabulator unit tests (Approval.test.ts :: "Single Winner Test").
Dave has the most approvals and wins. In the original two rows carried out-of-bounds
marks (a 2 and a -1) that BetterVoting counts as 0/not-approved; here they are written
as plain 0 so the file validates under this engine while preserving every approval total.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's approvals (`1` = approve, `0`/blank = not approved).

Markers on these ballots: `-` blank · `~` race abstention · `&` candidate abstention · `?` spoiled · `%` spoiled+reissued — all tabulate as 0 (reported honestly).
