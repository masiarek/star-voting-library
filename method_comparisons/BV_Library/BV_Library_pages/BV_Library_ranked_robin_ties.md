# BV parity — Ranked Robin: Copeland tie broken by tiebreak order

*Generated from [`BV_Library_ranked_robin_ties.yaml`](../BV_Library_ranked_robin_ties.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [Ranked Robin (RCV-RR / Copeland)](../../../00_start_here/RCV_Ranked_Robin) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Alice

## Scenario

Ported from BetterVoting's tabulator unit tests (RankedRobin.test.ts :: "Ties").
Alice and Bob split the head-to-head (3-3), tying on Copeland score; BetterVoting
breaks the tie by tiebreak (lot) order and elects Alice. Rank ballots (1 = best)
converted to scores for the LH engine (rank 1->4, 2->3, 3->2, 4->1).

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Alice,Bob,Carol,Dave
4,3,2,1
4,3,2,1
4,3,2,1
3,4,2,1
3,4,2,1
3,4,2,1
```

## What the engine says

Full report from the [`_tabulated` mirror](../BV_Library_tabulated/BV_Library_ranked_robin_ties_tabulated.txt) (regenerated on every run; every analysis forced on):

--- Ranked Robin (RCV-RR / Copeland) Method (single winner) ---
 Tabulating 6 ballots (score ballots).

Ballots:
   the ranking Ranked Robin reads ("=" = tied); source scores follow in () per column: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave
     3 × Alice > Bob > Carol > Dave      (4, 3, 2, 1)
     3 × Bob > Alice > Carol > Dave      (3, 4, 2, 1)

Round-Robin — every pair, head-to-head (For – Against):
   Alice  ties  Bob     3 – 3
   Alice  beats Carol   6 – 0
   Alice  beats Dave    6 – 0
   Bob    beats Carol   6 – 0
   Bob    beats Dave    6 – 0
   Carol  beats Dave    6 – 0

Win–loss record — Copeland score = wins + ½·ties (most wins wins; ties broken by total margin, then lot order):
    #  Candidate  W–L–T  Copeland  Margin  Beats
    1  Alice      2–0–1       2.5     +12  Carol, Dave
    2  Bob        2–0–1       2.5     +12  Carol, Dave
    3  Carol      1–2–0         1      -6  Dave
    4  Dave       0–3–0         0     -18  —

Winner — Ranked Robin (RCV-RR): Alice
   *** 2 candidates tie on wins (Alice, Bob) — a Condorcet cycle. Resolved by total margin, then lot order. (This is where Minimax / Ranked Pairs / Schulze differ — see 00_start_here/RCV_Ranked_Robin/cycle_resolution.md.)
