# BV parity — STAR: runoff & score tie, five-star tiebreaker

*Generated from [`BV_Library_star_runoff_score_tie_five_star.yaml`](../BV_Library_star_runoff_score_tie_five_star.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Allison

## Scenario

Ported from BetterVoting's tabulator unit tests
(Star.test.ts :: "Runoff & Score Tie, use five-star tiebreaker to resolve").
Score totals and runoff both tie; the five-star count breaks it for Allison.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Allison,Bill
2,4
5,3
```
