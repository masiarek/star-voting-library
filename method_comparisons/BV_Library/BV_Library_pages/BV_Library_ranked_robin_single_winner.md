# BV parity — Ranked Robin: Condorcet winner (equal ranks allowed)

*Generated from [`BV_Library_ranked_robin_single_winner.yaml`](../BV_Library_ranked_robin_single_winner.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [Ranked Robin (RCV-RR / Copeland)](../../../00_start_here/RCV_Ranked_Robin) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Alice

## Scenario

Ported from BetterVoting's tabulator unit tests (RankedRobin.test.ts :: "Single winner test").
BetterVoting supplies rank ballots (1 = best) including EQUAL ranks and an abstention.
Converted here to score ballots for the LH engine (higher score = more preferred,
equal scores = equal rank, blank = unranked): rank 1->4, 2->3, 3->2, 4->1, unranked->0.
One original out-of-bounds mark (rank -1 for Dave) becomes a blank. Alice wins every
head-to-head (Condorcet winner); Copeland scores match BetterVoting (Alice 3, Bob 2,
Carol 1, Dave 0).

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

Markers on these ballots: `-` blank · `~` race abstention · `&` candidate abstention · `?` spoiled · `%` spoiled+reissued — all tabulate as 0 (reported honestly).

Full report from the [`_tabulated` mirror](../BV_Library_tabulated/BV_Library_ranked_robin_single_winner_tabulated.txt) (regenerated on every run; every analysis forced on):

--- Ranked Robin (RCV-RR / Copeland) Method (single winner) ---
 Tabulating 11 ballots (score ballots).

Ballots:
   the ranking Ranked Robin reads ("=" = tied); source scores follow in () per column: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave
     1 × Alice > Bob > Carol > Dave      (4, 3, 2, 0)
     2 × Alice > Bob > Carol > Dave      (4, 3, 2, 1)
     2 × Alice=Bob > Carol > Dave      (4, 4, 3, 2)
     2 × Bob > Alice > Carol > Dave      (3, 4, 2, 1)
     1 × Carol > Alice > Bob > Dave      (3, 2, 4, 1)
     1 × Dave > Alice > Bob > Carol      (3, 2, 1, 4)
     1 × Alice=Bob=Carol=Dave      (0, 0, 0, 0)
     1 × Alice > Bob > Carol > Dave      (3, 2, 1, 0)

Round-Robin — every pair, head-to-head (For – Against):
   Alice  beats Bob     6 – 2
   Alice  beats Carol   9 – 1
   Alice  beats Dave    9 – 1
   Bob    beats Carol   9 – 1
   Bob    beats Dave    9 – 1
   Carol  beats Dave    9 – 1
