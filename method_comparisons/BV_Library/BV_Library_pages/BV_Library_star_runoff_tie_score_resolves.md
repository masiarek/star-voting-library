# BV parity — STAR: runoff tie broken by score

*Generated from [`BV_Library_star_runoff_tie_score_resolves.yaml`](../BV_Library_star_runoff_tie_score_resolves.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Bill

## Scenario

Ported from BetterVoting's tabulator unit tests (Star.test.ts :: "Runoff tie, score resolves").
The runoff ties, and the higher score total resolves it in Bill's favor.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Allison,Bill
0,5
3,2
