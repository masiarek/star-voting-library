# BV parity — STAR: highest-scoring Condorcet winner

*Generated from [`BV_Library_star_condorcet_winner.yaml`](../BV_Library_star_condorcet_winner.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Allison

## Scenario

Ported from BetterVoting's tabulator unit tests (Star.test.ts :: "Condorcet Winner").
Allison is both the highest-scoring candidate and the Condorcet winner; Carmen is
the runner-up in BetterVoting's result.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).
