# Summability demo — RCV-IRV district B (B wins)

*Generated from [`irv_district_B.yaml`](../irv_district_B.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [RCV-IRV (Instant Runoff)](../../../00_start_here/RCV_IRV) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** B

## Scenario

District B of the RCV-IRV summability trio: B wins here too — both districts
independently elect B. Yet the combined electorate does NOT elect B (see
irv_combined.yaml: B is eliminated first there). District winners, and even
full district round-by-round tallies, cannot be summed into the combined
result — the non-summability this trio demonstrates.

## Ballots

Each row is one voter's ranking, most-preferred first (`N:` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
6:C
4:B
3:A>B>C
```
