# Summability demo — STAR combined A+B (Oak; precinct subtotals add up)

*Generated from [`star_combined.yaml`](../star_combined.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Oak

**Official tie-break (lot) order:** Maple > Oak > Pine — consulted only if every deterministic tiebreaker stays tied ([how the ladder works](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md)).

## Scenario

Districts A + B merged (all six ballots): Oak wins the combined STAR count.
Check it against the two district files — every score total and every
pairwise-matrix cell here is exactly the SUM of the districts' published
subtotals. No central ballot pile, no recount: precincts report, totals add.
That is summability; the irv_* trio shows RCV-IRV failing exactly this
test.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Maple, Oak, Pine
5,4,0
5,3,1
0,2,5
1,5,4
0,5,3
4,0,5
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = Oak
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Maple   (differs from STAR)

--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---

[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 6 ballots.
Maple,Oak,Pine
    5,  4,   0
    5,  3,   1
    0,  2,   5
    1,  5,   4
    0,  5,   3
    4,  0,   5

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Oak           -- 19 -- First place
   Pine          -- 18 -- Second place
   Maple         -- 15
 Oak and Pine advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Oak           -- 4 -- First place
   Pine          -- 2
   Equal Support -- 0
 Oak wins.
   Runoff math:
     6  ballots cast
   − 0  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ─
     6  voters with a preference  (majority = 4)
           Oak 4 (67%)  ·  Pine 2 (33%)

[STAR Voting: Winner — STAR Voting Method (single winner)]

[Condorcet Winner]
  No strict Condorcet winner; weak Condorcet winner: Oak — matches the STAR winner
