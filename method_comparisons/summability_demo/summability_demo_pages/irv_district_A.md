# Summability demo — RCV-IRV district A (B wins)

*Generated from [`irv_district_A.yaml`](../irv_district_A.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [RCV-IRV (Instant Runoff)](../../../00_start_here/RCV_IRV) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** B

## Scenario

District A of the RCV-IRV summability trio: C is eliminated, C's ballots
transfer to B, B wins. Looks precinct-friendly — until you try to combine
districts. See irv_combined.yaml: no fixed set of district-level IRV
subtotals can be added into the combined answer, because who gets eliminated
depends on ALL ballots at once.

## Ballots

Each row is one voter's ranking, most-preferred first (`N:` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
6:A
4:B
3:C>B>A
```
