# Summability demo — STAR district B (Oak wins — a runoff reversal)

*Generated from [`star_district_B.yaml`](../star_district_B.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Oak

**Official tie-break (lot) order:** Maple > Oak > Pine — consulted only if every deterministic tiebreaker stays tied ([how the ladder works](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md)).

## Scenario

District B of the STAR summability trio — the other half of the
star_combined electorate. Publish its per-candidate score sums and pairwise
matrix, add them to district A's, and you have the combined election's
entire count: that's summability, and it's what makes STAR precinct-friendly
and cheap to audit. Contrast the irv_* files, whose district tallies cannot
be combined.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Maple, Oak, Pine
1,5,4
0,5,3
4,0,5

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Oak — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR     = Oak
  Approval = Pine   (differs from STAR)

Majority Preference Enforcement Principle:
 - Score Round Winner(s) = (Pine)
 - Runoff Round Winner   = (Oak)
  Candidate Pine earned the highest total score,
  but Candidate Oak won the automatic runoff by being the head-to-head majority favorite.

   Pine          -- 1
   Equal Support -- 0
 Oak wins.
