# Summability demo — STAR district A (Maple wins outright)

*Generated from [`star_district_A.yaml`](../star_district_A.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Maple

**Official tie-break (lot) order:** Maple > Oak > Pine — consulted only if every deterministic tiebreaker stays tied ([how the ladder works](../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting/Tie_Breaking_STAR/tie_breaking.md)).

## Scenario

District A of the STAR summability trio: 3 ballots, Maple wins. The point of
the trio: STAR's precinct subtotals — per-candidate score sums and the
pairwise matrix — can be published as-is and simply ADDED. See
star_combined.yaml, where this district's tallies and district B's sum,
cell by cell, to the combined result with no ballot-level recount.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Maple, Oak, Pine
5,4,0
5,3,1
0,2,5
```
