# Summability demo — RCV-IRV combined A+B (B eliminated; not summable)

*Generated from [`irv_combined.yaml`](../irv_combined.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [RCV-IRV (Instant Runoff)](../../../00_start_here/RCV_IRV) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** A

## Scenario

Districts A + B merged, counted by RCV-IRV. B won BOTH districts — but in
the combined electorate B has the fewest first choices (8 vs 9 and 9), is
eliminated first, and both B-bullet blocs exhaust. The race then ends in a
GENUINE 9-9 tie between A and C; the engine's seeded coin flip elects A (see
the note at expected_winners). No district subtotal can produce this result:
IRV needs every ballot in one pile. Compare the star_* trio, where
subtotals simply add.

## Ballots

Each row is one voter's ranking, most-preferred first (`N:` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
6:A
4:B
3:C>B>A
6:C
4:B
3:A>B>C
```
