# Non-monotonicity (RCV-IRV) — part 1: baseline, X wins

*Generated from [`monotonicity_irv_before.yaml`](../monotonicity_irv_before.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [RCV-IRV (Instant Runoff)](../../../00_start_here/RCV_IRV) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** X

## Scenario

Part 1 of the RCV-IRV monotonicity pair: 34 voters, X wins (Z is eliminated,
Z's ballots transfer to X). This is the baseline for the paradox — in part 2
(monotonicity_irv_after.yaml) four voters RAISE X from second to first
choice, change nothing else, and X LOSES. Keep both files side by side; the
ballots differ only in those four voters.

## Ballots

Each row is one voter's ranking, most-preferred first (`N:` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
12:X>Y
12:Y>Z
10:Z>X
```
