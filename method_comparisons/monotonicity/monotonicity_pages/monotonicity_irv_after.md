# Non-monotonicity (RCV-IRV) — part 2: raising X makes X lose

*Generated from [`monotonicity_irv_after.yaml`](../monotonicity_irv_after.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [RCV-IRV (Instant Runoff)](../../../00_start_here/RCV_IRV) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Z

## Scenario

Part 2 of the RCV-IRV monotonicity pair: four Y>Z voters move X up to first
(12:X>Y becomes 16:X>Y), a pure GAIN of support for X — and X now loses.
The extra support changed the elimination order: Y goes out first, Y's
ballots feed Z, and Z beats X 18-16. More support made the winner lose —
IRV's non-monotonicity. STAR cannot do this (more points never hurt); see
the monotonicity_star_* pair and the monotonicity topic hub.

## Ballots

Each row is one voter's ranking, most-preferred first (`N:` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
16:X>Y
8:Y>Z
10:Z>X
```
