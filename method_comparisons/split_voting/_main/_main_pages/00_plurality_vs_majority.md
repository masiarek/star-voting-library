# Plurality vs Majority — most votes isn't more than half

*Generated from [`00_plurality_vs_majority.yaml`](../00_plurality_vs_majority.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Blake

## Scenario

100 voters, three candidates. First choices: Andre 40, Blake 35, Carmen 25.

Under Choose-One Plurality, Andre wins with 40 — the MOST votes. But 60 of 100
voters preferred someone else, so Andre has no MAJORITY. Blake and Carmen appeal
to the same 60-voter coalition; Choose-One splits it across two names and hands
the seat to the candidate a majority actively voted against.

STAR scores all three 0–5, so coalition voters back both Blake and Carmen. The two
highest totals (Blake, Carmen) advance, and the automatic runoff produces a winner
who holds a majority between the finalists — Blake. Watch [Divergence from STAR]
show Choose-One (Plurality) = Andre disagreeing with STAR, and the [Vote-splitting
check] confirm the 60-vote coalition. ("Most votes" and "over half" are different
bars; the gap only appears with 3+ candidates — that gap is where vote splitting
lives.)

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Count:Andre,Blake,Carmen
40:5,0,0   # Andre bloc — most first choices, but a minority of the whole
35:0,5,4   # Blake base — also support coalition ally Carmen
25:0,4,5   # Carmen base — also support coalition ally Blake
```

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: Blake — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = Blake
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Andre   (differs from STAR)

[Vote-splitting check]
  Choose-One first choices: Andre 40, Blake 35, Carmen 25
  Plurality winner: Andre (40, 40.0%)
  Bloc 'Coalition' = Blake, Carmen: combined 60 (60.0%); winner Andre is OUTSIDE it.
  => VOTE SPLITTING: the 'Coalition' bloc is an outright majority (60 vs
     Andre's 40) but split across 2 candidates, so Andre won Choose-One.
     STAR elected Blake.
