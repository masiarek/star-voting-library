# Spoiler — chocolate's majority splits, vanilla steals the win

*Generated from [`02_icecream_chocolate_split.yaml`](../02_icecream_chocolate_split.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** MilkChoco

## Scenario

100 dessert voters. Chocolate lovers are a 66% MAJORITY, but there are THREE
chocolates on the menu — DarkChoco, MilkChoco, and ChocoChip. Only 34 prefer
Vanilla.

Under Choose-One each voter picks one flavor, so chocolate splits: DarkChoco
24, MilkChoco 22, ChocoChip 20. Vanilla wins with 34 of 100 — a flavor a
two-thirds majority didn't want. Classic vote splitting.

STAR lets chocolate lovers give all three chocolates high scores, so the
majority isn't split. The runoff elects MilkChoco — the chocolate everyone in
the bloc can live with — over the spoiler Vanilla.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Count:DarkChoco,MilkChoco,ChocoChip,Vanilla
24:5,4,2,0   # dark base — also like milk
22:4,5,4,0   # milk base — like all chocolate
20:2,4,5,0   # chip base — also like milk
34:0,0,0,5   # vanilla bloc
```

[Condorcet Winner]
  Condorcet Winner: MilkChoco — matches the STAR winner

[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = MilkChoco
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Vanilla   (differs from STAR)

[Vote-splitting check]
  Choose-One first choices: Vanilla 34, DarkChoco 24, MilkChoco 22, ChocoChip 20
  Plurality winner: Vanilla (34, 34.0%)
  Bloc 'Chocolate' = DarkChoco, MilkChoco, ChocoChip: combined 66 (66.0%); winner Vanilla is OUTSIDE it.
  => VOTE SPLITTING: the 'Chocolate' bloc is an outright majority (66 vs
     Vanilla's 34) but split across 3 candidates, so Vanilla won Choose-One.
     STAR elected MilkChoco.
