# Spoiler — a split coalition hands the seat to the minority

*Generated from [`01_political_left_split.yaml`](../01_political_left_split.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Labour

## Scenario

100 voters. A progressive coalition — Green, Labour, and SocialDem — is a clear
66% MAJORITY. One Conservative holds the other 34%.

Under Choose-One Plurality each voter names a single party, so the coalition
splits: Green 24, Labour 22, SocialDem 20. The Conservative wins with just 34
of 100 — a candidate two-thirds of voters ranked LAST. That is the spoiler
effect at full force.

STAR lets every voter score all four 0–5, so coalition voters can back all
three progressive parties. The two highest totals advance, and the automatic
runoff elects Labour — the coalition's broad consensus pick — not the minority
Conservative. Watch the [Vote-splitting check] confirm it.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Count:Green,Labour,SocialDem,Conservative
24:5,4,2,0   # Green base — also like Labour
22:4,5,4,0   # Labour base — like the whole coalition
20:2,4,5,0   # SocialDem base — also like Labour
34:0,0,0,5   # Conservative bloc
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = Labour
  Choose-One (Plurality) = Conservative   (differs from STAR)

[Vote-splitting check]
  Choose-One first choices: Conservative 34, Green 24, Labour 22, SocialDem 20
  Plurality winner: Conservative (34, 34.0%)
  Bloc 'Coalition' = Green, Labour, SocialDem: combined 66 (66.0%); winner Conservative is OUTSIDE it.
  => VOTE SPLITTING: the 'Coalition' bloc is an outright majority (66 vs
     Conservative's 34) but split across 3 candidates, so Conservative won
     Choose-One. STAR elected Labour.
