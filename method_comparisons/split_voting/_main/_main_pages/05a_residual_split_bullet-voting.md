# STAR's residual split — a coalition bullet-votes itself apart

*Generated from [`05a_residual_split_bullet-voting.yaml`](../05a_residual_split_bullet-voting.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** Cara

## Scenario

The honest caveat to "STAR ends vote-splitting": it ends the FORCED kind. A
faction can still split ITSELF if it refuses to use the score ballot.

Ada and Ben are on the same side (60 voters); Cara is the opponent (40). Here the
Ada/Ben side bullet-votes tribally — Ada-fans give Ben a 0, Ben-fans give Ada a
0 — instead of scoring their ally honestly. Scores: Ada 175, Ben 125, Cara 200.
Cara grabs a finalist slot on a split field and wins the runoff, even though 60%
preferred that side. STAR did not rescue a split the voters inflicted on
themselves: the residual lives only in the top-two runoff.

The cure is in their hands — see 05b_residual_split_expressive-fix.yaml, where the
SAME factions score their ally even a 3 and STAR elects the majority side.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Count:Ada,Ben,Cara
35:5,0,0   # Ada-fans bullet-vote — refuse to score their ally Ben
25:0,5,0   # Ben-fans bullet-vote — refuse to score their ally Ada
40:0,0,5   # Cara bloc (the minority side)
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Vote-splitting check]
  Choose-One first choices: Cara 40, Ada 35, Ben 25
  Plurality winner: Cara (40, 40.0%)
  Bloc 'Allies' = Ada, Ben: combined 60 (60.0%); winner Cara is OUTSIDE it.
  => VOTE SPLITTING: the 'Allies' bloc is an outright majority (60 vs Cara's
     40) but split across 2 candidates, so Cara won Choose-One. STAR elected
     Cara.

--- STAR Voting Method (single winner) ---

[STAR Voting]
 Tabulating 100 ballots.
Count × Ada,Ben,Cara
   40 ×   0,  0,   5
   35 ×   5,  0,   0
   25 ×   0,  5,   0

[STAR Voting: Scoring Round]
 The two highest-scoring candidates advance to the next round.
   Cara          -- 200 -- First place
   Ada           -- 175 -- Second place
   Ben           -- 125
 Cara and Ada advance.

[STAR Voting: Automatic Runoff Round]
 The candidate preferred in the most head-to-head matchups wins.
   Cara          -- 40 -- First place
   Ada           -- 35
   Equal Support -- 25
 Cara wins.
   Runoff math:
     100  ballots cast
   −  25  Equal Support (no preference between the two finalists)
     ───
      75  voters with a preference  (majority = 38)
           Cara 40 (53%)  ·  Ada 35 (47%)
