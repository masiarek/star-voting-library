# Spoiler — the veggie majority splits, the burger wins the lunch vote

*Generated from [`03_lunch_veggie_vs_meat.yaml`](../03_lunch_veggie_vs_meat.yaml) — do not edit by hand. Regenerate: `python STARVote_LH_tabulation_engine/tools_adam/scripts/build_yaml_pages.py`.*

**Method:** [STAR (single winner)](../../../../00_start_here/STAR_Voting) · **1 seat** · **Expected winner:** VeggieCurry

## Scenario

100 people vote on ONE dish to cater. A 70% MAJORITY wants vegetarian, but the
veggie vote is spread across three dishes — VeggieCurry, TofuStirFry, and
GardenSalad. A single BeefBurger holds the other 30%.

Under Choose-One each person picks one dish, so the veggie vote splits:
TofuStirFry 28, VeggieCurry 26, GardenSalad 16. BeefBurger wins with just 30 of
100 — even though 70% wanted something vegetarian. The split handed the win to
the minority.

STAR lets veggie voters score all three vegetarian dishes, so the majority
isn't split. The runoff elects VeggieCurry — the dish the most veggie voters
can agree on — instead of the spoiler BeefBurger.

## Ballots

Row 1 = candidate names; each later row is one voter's 0–5 scores (a `N ×` prefix = N identical ballots).

```text
Count:VeggieCurry,TofuStirFry,GardenSalad,BeefBurger
26:5,4,4,0   # curry base — like the other veggies
28:4,5,2,0   # tofu base — curry is a fine backup
16:4,2,5,0   # salad base — curry is a fine backup
30:0,0,0,5   # burger bloc
```

## What the engine says

The count, step by step — the rounds and how the winner is reached:

```text
[Divergence from STAR]
  STAR                   = VeggieCurry
  Choose-One (Plurality) = BeefBurger   (differs from STAR)

[Vote-splitting check]
  Choose-One first choices: BeefBurger 30, TofuStirFry 28, VeggieCurry 26, GardenSalad 16
  Plurality winner: BeefBurger (30, 30.0%)
  Bloc 'Veggie' = VeggieCurry, TofuStirFry, GardenSalad: combined 70 (70.0%); winner BeefBurger is OUTSIDE it.
  => VOTE SPLITTING: the 'Veggie' bloc is an outright majority (70 vs
     BeefBurger's 30) but split across 3 candidates, so BeefBurger won
     Choose-One. STAR elected VeggieCurry.
